Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent’s brain, complemented by several key components:\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.\\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n\\nShort-term memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\\nLong-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.\\n\\n\\nTool use\\n\\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary information sources and more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 1. Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\nFig. 2.  Examples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equips agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\nFig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent’s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.\\n\\nFig. 4. Experiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\nFig. 5. After fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\nThe idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.\\n\\nFig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\\n\\nFig. 7. Comparison of AD, ED, source policy and RL^2 on environments that require memory and exploration. Only binary reward is assigned. The source policies are trained with A3C for \"dark\" environments and DQN for watermaze.(Image source: Laskin et al. 2023)\\nComponent Two: Memory#\\n(Big thank you to ChatGPT for helping me draft this section. I’ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)\\u200b algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\\n\\nLSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$ to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\nFig. 9. Comparison of MIPS algorithms, measured in recall@10.

We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\\n\\nFig. 10. A picture of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water. While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short for “Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language”, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the “External APIs” section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\nFig. 11. Illustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\nThe system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\"task\": task, \"id\", task_id, \"dep\": dependency_task_ids, \"args\": {\"text\": text, \"image\": URL, \"audio\": URL, \"video\": URL}}]. The \"dep\" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag \"-task_id\" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can\\'t be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be in a strict JSON format: \"id\": \"id\", \"reason\": \"your detail reason for the choice\". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{ Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.\\n\\n(3) Task execution: Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nWith the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }}, Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user\\'s request in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.\\n\\n(4) Response generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results to users.\\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\\nAPI-Bank (Li et al. 2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs. It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow, and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.\\n\\nFig. 12. Pseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\nIn the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent’s tool use capabilities at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an API’s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user’s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\nCase Studies#\\nScientific Discovery Agent#\\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow, implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\nThe LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\\n\\nOne interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al. (2023) also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\\nFor example, when requested to \"develop a novel anticancer drug\", the model came up with the following reasoning steps:\\n\\ninquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\\nselected a target;\\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\\nOnce the compound was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.\\n\\nThey also discussed the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure. 7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\\nGenerative Agents Simulation#\\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents’ experience in natural language.\\n\\nEach element is an observation, an event directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to inform the agent’s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency: recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent’s future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements. Then ask LM to answer those questions.\\n\\n\\nPlanning & Reacting: translate the reflections and the environment information into actions\\n\\nPlanning is essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\\nPrompt template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X\\'s plan today in broad strokes: 1)\\nRelationships between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration for planning and reacting.\\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 13. The generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023)\\nThis fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion, relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\\nProof-of-Concept Examples#\\nAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller. It has quite a lot of reliability issues given the natural language interface, but nevertheless a cool proof-of-concept demo. A lot of code in AutoGPT is about format parsing.\\nHere is the system message used by AutoGPT, where {{...}} are user inputs:\\nYou are {{ai-name}}, {{user-provided AI bot description}}.\\nYour decisions must always be made independently without seeking user assistance.

The design of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n\\nReliability of natural language interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently, much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\\n\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited as:\\n\\nWeng, Lilian. (Jun 2023). “LLM-powered Autonomous Agents”.

This bookbridges the gap between these two extremes, offering a textbook that studies economic activ-ity in financial markets, focusing on how consumers determine future consumption and onthe role of financial securities. Areas covered in the book include:\\n• An examination of the role of finance in the economy using basic economic principles,\\neventually progressing to introductory graduate analysis.\\n• A microeconomic study of capital asset pricing when there is risk, inflation, taxes and\\nasymmetric information.\\n• An emphasis on economic intuition using geometry to explain formal analysis.• An extended treatment of corporate finance and the evaluation of public policy.\\nWritten by an experienced teacher of financial economics and microeconomics at both\\ngraduate and postgraduate level, this book is essential reading for students seeking to studythe links between economics and finance and those with a special interest in capital assetpricing, corporate finance, derivative securities, insurance, policy evaluation and discountrates.\\nChris Jones is Senior Lecturer at the School of Economics at The Australian National\\nUniversity.', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

They initially consume from parentalincome before commencing work, whereupon their income normally increases until it peakstoward the end of their working life and then declines at retirement. An example of theincome profile ( I\\nt) for a consumer who lives until time Tis shown by the solid line in \\nFigure 1.1. When resources can be transferred between time periods the consumer canchoose to smooth consumption expenditure ( X\\nt) to make it look like the dashed line in the\\ndiagram.\\nAlmost all consumption choices have intertemporal effects when individuals can transfer\\nresources between time periods. Any good that provides (or funds) future consumption isreferred to as a capital asset , and consumers trade these assets to determine the shape of the\\nconsumption profile. In Figure 1.1 the individual initially sells capital assets (borrows) toraise consumption above income, and later purchases capital assets (saves) to repay debt andsave for retirement and the payment of bequests. These trades smooth consumption expen-diture relative to income, where consumption profiles are determined by consumer prefer-ences, resources endowments and investment opportunities.\\nThere are physical and financial capital assets: physical assets such as houses and cars\\ngenerate real consumption flows plus capital gains or losses, and financial assets have mon-etary payouts plus any capital gains or losses that can be converted into consumption goods.There are important links between them as many financial assets are used to fund invest-ment in physical assets, where this gives them property right claims to their payouts. In fric-tionless competitive markets, asset values are a signal of the marginal benefits to sellers andmarginal costs to buyers from trading future consumption. In effect, buyers and sellers arevaluing the same payouts to capital assets when they make decisions to trade them, which iswhy so much effort is devoted to the derivation of capital asset pricing models in financialeconomics, particularly in the presence of uncertainty. Consumers will not pay a positiveprice for any asset unless it is expected to generate a net consumption flow for them in thefuture. In many cases these benefits might be reductions in consumption risk rather thanincreases in expected consumption. In fact, a large variety of financial securities trade infinancial markets to facilitate trades in consumption risk.\\nWhile much of the material covered in this book examines trade in financial markets and\\nthe pricing of financial securities, there are important links between the real and financialvariables in the economy. After all, financial markets function to facilitate the trades in realconsumption, where financial securities reduce trading costs, particularly when consump-tion is transferred across time. Their prices provide important signals of the marginal valu-ations and costs of future consumption flows.

       " Document(page_content='financial variables in the economy, we examine the way capital asset prices change over\\ntime, and how they are affected by taxes, leverage, risk, new information and inflation. Inparticular, we look at how financial decisions affect real consumption opportunities.\\nA useful starting point for the analysis is the classical finance model with frictionless and\\ncompetitive markets where traders have common information. In this setting the financialpolicy irrelevance theorems of Modigliani and Miller (1958, 1961) hold, where financialsecurities are a veil over the real economy. That is not to say these securities are irrelevantto the real economy, but rather, the types of financial securities used and the way they makepayouts, whether as consumption, cash or capital gains, are irrelevant. This is an importantproposition because it reminds us that the values of financial securities are ultimately deter-mined by the net consumption flows they provide – in other words, by their fundamentals.While this model appears at odds with reality, it provides an important benchmark for grad-ually extending the analysis to a more realistic setting with trading costs, taxes and asym-metric information to explain the interactions we observe between the real and financialvariables in the economy. Considerable progress has been made in deriving asset pricingmodels in recent years by linking prices back to consumption, which is the ultimate sourceof value because it determines the utility of consumers. Most of this work is undertaken in classical finance models, where departures from it attempt to make the pricing modelsperform better empirically.\\nThis book aims to bridge the material covered in most undergraduate finance courses\\nwith material covered in a first-year graduate finance course. Thus, it can be used as a textbook for third-year undergraduate and honours courses in finance and financial economics. Another aim is to provide policy analysts with an accessible reference for evaluating policy changes with risky benefits and costs that extend into future time periods.The most challenging material is presented at the end of Chapter 4, where four popular consumption-based pricing models are derived, and in Chapter 8 on project evaluation and the social discount rate. I benefited enormously from reading many of the works listedin the References section, but two books were particularly helpful. The book by JohnCochrane (2001) provides nice insights into the economics of asset pricing, and is well supported by the book by Yvan Lengwiler (2004) that carefully establishes the properties ofthe consumption-based pricing model where the analysis in Cochrane starts.2Introduction\\n0Time ( t)Xt, It\\nConsumption ( Xt)\\nIncome ( It)\\nT\\nFigure 1.1 Income and consumption profiles.', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 14}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='In this book I have expanded the material on corporate finance and included material on\\nproject evaluation. Corporate finance is an ideal application in financial economics becausea large portion of aggregate investment is undertaken by corporate firms. It provides us withan opportunity to examine the role of taxes and the effects of firm financial policies on theirmarket valuations. Welfare analysis is used in the evaluation of public sector projects, andto identify the efficiency and equity effects of resource allocations by trades in private mar-kets. In distorted markets policy analysts use different rules than private traders for evaluat-ing capital investment decisions. These differences are examined and we extend acompensated welfare analysis to identify the welfare effects of changes in consumption risk.For that reason the book may also be useful as a reference for courses in cost–benefit analy-sis, public economics and the economics of taxation. We now summarize the material covered in each of the following chapters.\\n1.1 Chapter summaries\\nIntertemporal decisions under uncertainty\\nUncertainty obviously impacts on intertemporal consumption choices, where consumers,\\nwhen valuing capital assets, apply discount factors to their future net consumption flows ascompensation for the opportunity cost of time and risk. Rather than include both time andrisk from the outset, we follow Hirshleifer (1965) in Chapter 2 by using certainty analysisto identify the opportunity cost of time. This conveniently extends standard atemporal eco-nomic analysis to multiple time periods without the complication of also including uncer-tainty. It is included later in Chapter 3 using a two-period Arrow–Debreu state-preferencemodel, which is a natural extension of the certainty analysis in Chapter 2. By proceeding inthis manner we establish a solid foundation for the more advanced material covered in laterchapters. Some graduate finance books treat uncertainty analysis, and in some cases, state-preference theory, as assumed knowledge.\\nThe certainty analysis commences in an autarky economy where individuals effectively\\nlive on islands. We do this to identify actions consumers can take in isolation from eachother to transfer consumption to future time periods through private investment in capitalassets. For example, they can store commodities, plant trees and other crops as well as buildhouses to provide direct consumption benefits in the future. While this is a simplisticdescription of the choices available to most consumers, it establishes useful properties thatwill carry over to a more realistic setting. In particular, it identifies potential gains fromtrade, where the nature of these gains is identified by gradually introducing trading oppor-tunities to the autarky economy. We initially extend the analysis by allowing consumers toexchange goods within each time period (atemporal trade) where transactions costs areintroduced to provide a role for (fiat) money and financial securities.\\nIt is quite easy to overlook some of the important roles of money and financial securities\\nin a more general setting with risk, taxes, externalities and asymmetric information. In a cer-tainty setting without taxes and other distortions consumers use them to reduce the costs ofmoving goods around the exchange economy . Money and financial securities will coexist as\\na medium of exchange if they provide different cost reductions for different transactions.Since money is highly divisible and universally accepted as a medium of exchange, itreduces trading costs on relatively low-valued transactions. In contrast, financial securitiesare used for larger-valued transactions and trades with more complex property right trans-fers which are less easily verified at the time the exchanges occur.\\n1If commodities are Introduction 3', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 15}),\n",

Money is frequently not included infinance models due to the absence of trading costs on the grounds they are too small to playa significant role in the analysis. That also eliminates any transactions cost role for finan-cial securities. When money is included in these circumstances it becomes a veil over thereal economy so that nominal prices are determined by the supply of money.\\n2Once trading\\ncosts are included, however, money and financial securities can have real effects on equilib-rium outcomes.\\nWhen consumers can trade atemporally in frictionless competitive markets they equate\\ntheir marginal utility from allocating income to each good consumed. This allows us to sim-plify the analysis considerably by defining consumer preferences over income on the basisthat consumption bundles are being chosen optimally in the background to maximize util-ity. This continues to be the case in the presence of uncertainty when there is a single con-sumption good. However, with multiple goods, risk-averse consumers care not only aboutchanges in their (expected) money income in future time periods but also about changes inrelative commodity prices as both determine the changes in their real income.\\n3This obser-\\nvation makes it easier to understand why in some pricing models the risk premiums aredetermined by changes in relative commodity prices.\\nThe next extension to the autarky economy introduces full trade where consumers can\\ntrade within each period and across time (intertemporally) in a market economy. Initially weconsider an exchange model where consumers swap goods in each time period and use for-ward commodity contracts to trade goods over time. The analysis is then extended to anasset economy by allowing consumers to trade financial securities. As noted by Arrow\\n(1953), financial securities can significantly reduce the number of transactions. Instead oftrading a separate forward contract for each good consumed in the future, consumers cantrade money and financial securities with future payouts that can be converted into goods.Thus, money and financial securities can be used as a store of value to reduce the costs oftrading intertemporally. But this introduces a wealth effect in the money market due to thenon-payment of interest on currency. Whenever consumers hold currency as a store of value,they forgo interest payments on bonds; this acts as an implicit tax when the nominal inter-est rate exceeds the marginal social cost of supplying currency. Any anticipated expansionin the supply of fiat currency that raises the rate of price inflation and the nominal interestrate will increase the welfare loss from the non-payment of interest by further reducing thedemand for currency. There are other important interactions between financial and real vari-ables in the economy when we introduce risk and asymmetric information. By tradingintertemporally in frictionless competitive markets, consumers equate their marginal ratesof substitution between future and current consumption to the market rate of interest, andtherefore use the same discount factors to value capital assets.\\nAfter extending the asset economy to allow investment by firms, we then examine the\\nFisher separation theorem . This gives price-taking firms the familiar objective of maximiz-\\ning profit. Sometimes this objective is inappropriate. For example, shareholders are unlikelyto be unanimous in supporting profit maximization when the investment choices of firmsalso affect the relative prices of the goods they consume. The Fisher separation theoremholds when these investment choices only have income effects on the budget constraints ofshareholders. We then examine the effects of fully anticipated inflation in a classical financemodel where the real economy is unaffected by changes in the rate of general price infla-tion. This establishes the Fisher effect where nominal interest rates change endogenously to4Introduction', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 16}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='keep the real interest rate constant, so that current asset prices are unaffected by changes in\\ninflation. The real effects of inflation are obtained by relaxing assumptions in the classicalfinance model, including homogeneous expectations and flexible nominal prices.\\nFinally, the certainty analysis is completed by deriving asset prices for different types of\\nsecurities such as perpetuities, annuities, share and bonds. In general terms, capital assetprices are determined by the size and timing of their net cash flows and the term structureof interest rates used to discount them. While this may seem a relatively straightforwardexercise, it can become quite complicated in practice. There are many factors that canimpact on the net cash flows and their discount factors, including, storage, investmentopportunities, trading costs, inflation and taxes. After identifying the term structure of inter-est rates, we establish the fundamental equation of yield in a certainty setting. The termstructure establishes the relationship between short- and long-term interest rates. This isimportant for pricing assets when their net cash flows are spread across a number of futuretime periods because the discount factors need to reflect the differences in their timing. Riskpremiums are added to the short-term interest rates using an asset pricing model when thenet cash flows are risky. These adjustments are derived later in Chapters 3 and 4. The equa-tion of yield measures the economic return to capital invested in assets in each period oftheir lives. It identifies economic income as cash and consumption plus any capital gains orlosses. Some asset prices rise over time, some fall and others stay constant. It depends onthe size and timing of the cash flows they generate. Assets that delay paying net cash flowsuntil later time periods must pay capital gains in subsequent years to compensate capitalproviders for the opportunity cost of time. In contrast, the prices of assets with larger imme-diate cash flows are much more likely to fall in some periods of their lives. In a frictionlesscompetitive capital market every asset must pay the same economic rate of return as everyother asset (in the same risk class). This is the no arbitrage condition which eliminates profit\\nfrom security returns and makes them equal to the opportunity cost of time (and risk). It isan important relationship that appears time and again throughout the analysis in this book,and it provides extremely useful economic insights for predicting asset price changes andidentifying the economic returns on assets.\\nThe role of arbitrage can be demonstrated by computing the price of a financial asset with\\na net cash flow in the next period of X\\n1dollars when the nominal rate of interest over the\\nperiod is i1. It has a present value of\\n(1.1)\\nwhere the discount factor 1/(1 +i1) converts future dollars into fewer current dollars to com-\\npensate the asset holder for the opportunity cost of delaying consumption expenditure.Whenever the current asset price ( p\\n0) falls below PV0there is surplus with a net present\\nvalue of\\n(1.2)\\nPV0is the most the buyer would pay for this asset because it is the amount that would need\\nto be invested in other assets (in the same risk class) to generate the same net cash flow, withNPVX\\nip01\\n101=+−.PVX\\ni01\\n11=+,Introduction 5', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 17}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='PV0(1 +i1) =X1. In a frictionless competitive capital market arbitrage drives the market price\\nof the asset ( p0) to its present value ( PV0). If the asset price results in p0(1 +i1) >X1investors\\nmove into substitute assets which pay higher economic returns, while the reverse applieswhen p\\n0(1 +i1) <X1. When the no arbitrage condition holds, the asset price is equated to the\\npresent value of its net cash flows, so that NPV0=0. In these circumstances the discount rate\\n(i1) is the return every other asset (in the same risk class) pays over the same period of time.\\nDespite the simplicity of this example, it can be used to establish a number of very impor-\\ntant properties that should apply to asset values. First, their net cash flows are payouts madeto asset holders, and they are computed as gross revenue accruing to underlying real assetsminus any non-capital costs of production. Second, the discount rate should in every wayreflect the characteristics of the net cash flows being discounted. It should be the rate ofreturn paid on all other assets in the same risk class over the same time period. If the pay-outs are made in six months’ time the discount rate is the interest rate over that six-monthperiod, while assets that make a continuous payout through time should be evaluated usinga continuous discount factor. When the payouts are measured in nominal terms we use anominal discount rate, and for those measured in real terms a real discount rate. In the pres-ence of taxes we discount after-tax payouts using an after-tax discount rate. Finally, whenthe net cash flows are risky a premium is included in the discount rate to compensate assetholders for changes in their consumption risk. While these seem obvious points to make,they can nonetheless be easily overlooked in more complex present value calculations.\\nUncertainty and risk\\nA key role of financial securities is to spread and diversify risk, and these issues are exam-\\nined in Chapter 3. Many different types of securities trade in capital markets, includingshares, bonds, options, futures, warrants and convertible notes. Traders use them to tradeand diversify consumption risk and to obtain any profits through arbitrage. In a competitivecapital market there is a perfect substitute for every traded security, so that no one can pro-vide new risk trading opportunities by bringing a new security to the capital market. In otherwords, every new security can be replicated by creating a derivative security from existingtraded assets. In this setting, traders have no market power because other traders can com-bine options, bonds and shares to create perfect substitutes for their securities. This activityis important for invoking the no arbitrage condition on security returns when there is uncer-tainty and plays an important role in making the capital market efficient in the sense thatasset prices reflect all available information.\\nChapter 3 extends the analysis in the previous chapter by including uncertainty using the\\nArrow–Debreu state-preference model . This establishes the classical finance model in an\\nuncertainty setting where consumers have conditional perfect foresight, there are no tradingcosts and markets are competitive. It is equivalent to a certainty analysis where the charac-teristics of goods are expanded to make them state-contingent. The states of nature com-pletely summarize all possible outcomes of the world in the future, and everyone in theeconomy agrees on the state space and can solve the equilibrium outcomes in the economyin every state. The only remaining uncertainty is over the state that will actually eventuate.Most of the economic intuitions for the equilibrium allocations in the certainty setting willcarry over to this setting, except that consumers use stochastic discount factors to assess thevalues of capital assets.\\n4If the capital market is complete, so that consumers can trade in\\nevery state of the world, they use the same state-contingent discount factors and have the\\nsame marginal valuations for risky capital assets.6Introduction', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 18}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Risk-averse consumers include a risk premium in their discount factors when valuing net\\ncash flows on capital assets. This premium compensates them for risk imparted to theirfuture consumption by the net cash flows. But while every consumer includes the same riskpremium in their discount factors in the Arrow–Debreu model, they may not measure andprice risk in the same way. One of the main objectives of finance research is to obtain anasset pricing model where consumers measure and price risk identically so that financialanalysts can predict the market valuations of capital assets, and policy analysts can includea risk premium in the discount factors used to evaluate the net benefits on public sector proj-ects. The first important step in this direction is to adopt von Neumann–Morgensternexpected utility functions to separate the probabilities consumers assign to states of naturefrom the utility they derive in each state. Since these preferences are time-separable with astate-independent utility function, they transform the Arrow–Debreu pricing model into theconsumption-based pricing model where consumers face the same consumption risk and\\ntherefore measure and price risk identically.\\nAsset pricing models\\nFurther assumptions are required, however, to make the consumption-based pricing model a\\nsimple linear function of a few (ideally one) factors that isolate market risk in the net cashflows to securities. We derive four popular pricing models as special cases of the consumption-based pricing model in Chapter 4. They include the capital asset pricing model (CAPM)\\nderived by Sharpe (1964) and Lintner (1965), the intertemporal capital asset pricing model\\n(ICAPM) by Merton (1973a), the arbitrage pricing theory (APT) by Ross (1976) and the\\nconsumption-beta capital asset pricing model (CCAPM) by Breeden and Litzenberger\\n(1978) and Breeden (1979). All of them adopt assumptions that make the common stochas-tic discount factors of consumers linear in a set of factors that isolate aggregate consump-tion risk. And since these factors are variables reported in aggregate data, the models arerelatively straightforward for analysts to use when estimating the current values of capitalassets. In all of these models there is no risk premium for diversifiable risk in securityreturns because it can be costlessly eliminated by bundling risky securities in portfolios.Only the non-diversifiable (market) risk attracts a risk premium because it is risk that con-sumers must ultimately bear. Since this material is more difficult analytically, we followstandard practice by initially deriving the CAPM as the solution to the portfolio problem of consumers. In this two-period model consumers fund all their future consumption frompayouts to securities where consumption risk is determined by the risk in their portfolios.Since they have common information they combine the same bundle of risky securities witha risk-free security, where market risk is determined by the risk in their common riskybundle (known as the market portfolio). Thus, they measure risk in the returns to securitiesby their covariance with the return on the risky market portfolio. This is a widely used modelin practice because of its simplicity. There is a single measure of market risk in the econ-omy that all consumers price in the same way, where the market portfolio is normally constructed as a value-weighted index of the traded risky securities on the stock exchange.The problem with this model lies in the simplifying assumptions, in particular, that ofcommon information, no transactions costs and joint normally distributed returns.\\nWhen security returns are joint normally distributed the returns on security portfolios are\\ncompletely described by their mean and variance. This is why the CAPM is based on amean–variance analysis. The APT model is more general because it does not require secu-rity returns to be normally distributed. Instead, it is a linear factor analysis that isolatesIntroduction 7', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 19}),\n",

While the\\nfactors used are macroeconomic variables, they are not necessarily the source of the marketrisk in security returns. They are simply used to isolate it. We derive the APT model in a similar fashion to the derivation of the CAPM to demonstrate the role of arbitrage in eliminating diversifiable risk, and the role of mimicking portfolios to price the market riskisolated by the macro factors. The main weakness of this model is its failure to identify theset of common factors used by consumers.\\nIn the last three sections we derive the CAPM and the APT, as well as the ICAPM and the\\nCCAPM, as special cases of the consumption-based pricing model. Even though the analy-sis is slightly more complex, it provides much greater insight into the underlying econom-ics in these pricing models. In particular, it links the risk in securities directly back to therisk in consumption expenditure. Since consumers derive utility from consumption and facethe same consumption risk, they assess the risk in capital assets by measuring the covarianceof their returns with changes in aggregate consumption. Additional factors are requiredwhen aggregate consumption risk also changes over time. Each model has its strengths andweaknesses, and by deriving them as special cases of the consumption-based pricing model,they can be compared more effectively.\\nEarly empirical tests of these models focused on their ability to explain the risk premi-\\nums in expected security returns without considering how much risk was being transferredinto real consumption expenditure. When testing the CCAPM, Mehra and Prescott (1985)looked beyond its ability to explain the risk in asset prices and examined whether theimplied values of the (constant) coefficient of relative risk aversion and the (constant) rateof time preference were consistent with the risk in aggregate real consumption. Using US data, they discovered the equity premium and low risk-free real interest rate puzzles,where the premium puzzle finds the need to adopt a coefficient of relative risk aversion inthe CCAPM that is approximately five times larger than its estimated value in experimentalwork, while the low risk-free rate puzzle finds the observed real interest rate much lowerthan the CCAPM would predict when the coefficient of relative risk aversion is set at its esti-mated value. Once it is set at the higher values required to explain the observed equity riskpremium in security returns using the CCAPM, the predicted real interest rate is evenhigher. After summarizing these pricing puzzles we then look at subsequent attempts toexplain them by modifying preferences and including market frictions.\\nInsurance with asymmetric information\\nAs noted earlier, no risk premium is included in security returns for diversifiable risk in the\\nconsumption-based pricing models. This is referred to as the mutuality principle , and when\\nit holds, we cannot assess the risk in security returns by looking solely at their variance.Instead, we need to measure that part of their variance that cannot be costlessly eliminatedby bundling financial securities together or purchasing insurance. The diversification effectfrom bundling securities is examined in Chapters 3 and 4, while insurance is examined inChapter 5. Insurance markets allow consumers to pool individual risks, which are diversifi-able across the population. When insurance trades at actuarially fair prices (that is, at pricesequal to the probability of their losses), consumers with von Neumann–Morgenstern pref-erences fully insure. They purchase less insurance and do not eliminate all the diversifiablerisk from their consumption when there are marginal trading costs.\\nGovernments and international aid agencies often justify stabilization policies on the\\ngrounds that private insurance markets are distorted by moral hazard and adverse selection8Introduction', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 20}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='problems. These are problems that arise when traders have asymmetric information – in par-\\nticular, when insurers cannot costlessly observe the effort taken by consumers to reducetheir probability of incurring losses, or distinguish between consumers with different risk.Dixit (1987, 1989) makes the important observation that stabilization policies can only beassessed properly when they are evaluated in the presence of the moral hazard and adverseselection problems. We provide a basis for doing this by formalizing equilibrium outcomesin the market for private insurance when traders have asymmetric information. Its effects areidentified by comparing these outcomes to the equilibrium outcomes when traders havecommon information.\\nDerivative securities\\nThere are frequently circumstances where individuals take actions now so they can delay\\nmaking future consumption choices when uncertainty is partially resolved by the passingof time. Alternatively, they can eliminate some of the uncertainty in future consumptionnow by securing prices for future trades. Options contracts give holders the right but not\\nthe obligation to buy and sell commodities and financial assets at specified prices at (orbefore) specified times, while forward contracts are commitments to trade commodities\\nand financial assets at specified prices and times. These derivative securities play theimportant role of facilitating trades in aggregate risk and allowing investors to diversifyindividual risk by completing the capital market. They also provide valuable informationabout the expectations of investors for future values of underlying assets. Strictly speaking,derivatives are financial securities whose values derive from other financial securities, butthe term is used more widely to include options and forward contracts for commodities.\\n5\\nMicu and Upper (2006) report very large increases in the combined turnover in fixedincome, equity index and currency contracts (including both options and futures) on inter-national derivatives exchanges in recent years. Most of the financial contracts were for interest rates, government bonds, foreign exchange and stock indexes, while the maincommodity contracts were for metals (particularly gold), agricultural goods and energy(particularly oil).\\nAfter summarizing the payouts to these contracts, we then look at how they are priced in\\nChapter 6. An economic model could be used to solve the stochastic discount factors in theconsumption-based pricing model, but that involves solving the underlying asset prices. A preferable approach obtains a pricing model for derivatives that are functions of the cur-rent values of the underlying asset prices together with the restrictions specified by the con-tracts. Since the assets already trade we can use their current prices as inputs to the pricingmodel without trying to compute them. In effect, the approach works from the premise thatmarkets price assets efficiently and all we need to do is work out how the derivatives relateto the assets themselves. This is the approach adopted by Black and Scholes (1973) whoseoption pricing model values share options using five variables – the current share price, itsvariance, the expiry date, exercise price and the risk-free interest rate. It is a popular andwidely used model because this information is readily available, but it does rely on a numberof important assumptions, including that they are European options with fixed exercisedates, the underlying shares pay no dividends and they have a constant variance. We do notderive the Black–Scholes option pricing model formally, preferring instead to provide an\\nintuitive explanation for its separate components. Forward contracts are also valued usingthe current price of the underlying asset, the settlement date, margin requirements, pricelimits and storage costs when the asset is a storable commodity.Introduction 9', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 21}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Corporate finance\\nIn most economies a significant portion of aggregate investment is undertaken by corpo-\\nrate firms who can raise large amounts of risky capital by trading shares, bonds and other securities. In particular, they can issue limited liability shares that restrict the liabil-ity of shareholders to the value of their invested capital. In return, they are subject to statu-tory regulations that, among other things, specify information that must be reported toshareholders at specified times, and bankruptcy provisions to protect bondholders fromundue risk. A significant fraction of the value of financial securities that trade in capitalmarkets originate in the corporate sector. There are primary securities, such as debt andequity, as well as the numerous derivative securities written on them. In recent years alarger proportion of consumers hold these corporate securities, if not directly, then at leastindirectly through their superannuation and pension funds. We examine the role of risk andtaxes on corporate securities and on the market valuations of the firms who issue them inChapter 7. In particular, we look at the effects of their capital structure and dividend policychoices. For expository purposes the classical finance model is an ideal starting point forthe analysis because it establishes fundamental asset pricing relationships that can beextended to accommodate more realistic assumptions. In this setting, where consumershave common information in frictionless competitive capital markets, we obtain theModigliani–Miller financial policy irrelevance theorems . They are generalized where pos-\\nsible by including risk and taxes before introducing leverage related costs and asymmetricinformation.\\nMost countries have a classical corporate tax that taxes the income corporate firms pay\\ntheir shareholders but not interest payments on debt. This tax bias against equity encouragescorporate firms to increase their leverage. Early studies looked for leverage-related costs to\\nexplain the presence of equity in a classical finance model, including bankruptcy costs, andlost corporate tax shields due to the asymmetric treatment of profits and losses, which bothlead to optimal leverage policy choices. However, empirical studies could not find largeenough leverage costs to offset the tax bias against equity, so Miller (1977) examined thecombined effects of corporate and personal taxes and found that favourable tax treatment of\\ncapital gains could make equity preferable for investors in high tax brackets – that is, investorswith marginal personal tax rates on cash distributions that exceed the corporate tax rate bymore than their personal tax rates on capital gains. Most countries have progressive personaltax rates so that low-tax investors can have a tax preference for debt while high-tax investorshave a tax preference for capital gains. Once both securities trade, Modigliani–Mill er leverage\\nwill hold when consumers have common information. But this analysis by Miller producedthe dividend puzzle where no fully taxable consumers have a tax preference for dividends\\nover capital gains. Thus, shares pay no dividends in the Miller equilibrium . We examine a\\nnumber of different explanations for this puzzle, including differential transactions costs,share repurchase constraints that restrict the payment of capital gains, and dividend sig-nalling under asymmetric information. In the last section of this chapter we examine theimputation tax system used in Australia and New Zealand. This removes the double tax on\\ndividends by crediting shareholders with corporate tax paid, where the corporate tax is usedas withholding tax to discourage shareholders from realizing their income as capital gainsin the future. Since capital gains are taxed at realization, rather than when they accrue insidefirms, shareholders can reduce their effective tax rate on them by delaying realization. Thecorporate tax considerably reduces these benefits from retention by taxing income as itaccrues inside firms.10 Introduction', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 22}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Project evaluation and the social discount rate\\nGovernments also undertake a large portion of the aggregate investment in most economies,\\nwhere public sector agencies generally use different evaluation rules than those employedby private investors when markets are subject to distortions arising from taxes, externalities,non-competitive behaviour and the private underprovision of public goods. Private investorsmake investment choices to maximize their own welfare, while governments make invest-ment choices to maximize social welfare. These objectives coincide in economies whereresources are allocated in competitive markets without distortions (setting aside distribu-tional concerns). However, when markets are subject to distortions private investors evalu-ate projects using distorted prices, while governments look beyond these distortions andevaluate projects by measuring their impact on social welfare. These differences are demon-strated in Chapter 8 by evaluating public projects that provide pure public goods in a tax-distorted economy with aggregate uncertainty. The analysis is undertaken in a two-periodsetting where consumers have common information and von Neumann–Morgenstern preferences.\\nInitially we obtain optimality conditions for the provision of pure public goods in the\\nabsence of taxes and other distortions to provide a benchmark for identifying the effects ofdistorting taxes . This extends the original Samuelson (1954) condition to an intertemporal\\nsetting with uncertainty where the current value of the summed marginal consumption benefitsfrom the public good (MRS) is equated to the current value of the marginal resource cost(MRT ). When these costs and benefits occur in the second period they are discounted usinga stochastic discount factor, which, in the absence of taxes and other distortions, is the sameas the discount factor used by private investors. However, in the presence of trade taxes (andother distortions) there are additional welfare effects when the projects impact on taxedactivities. Any reduction in tax revenue is a welfare loss that increases the marginal cost ofgovernment spending, while the reverse applies when tax revenue rises. As a consequenceof these welfare changes, projects in one period can have welfare effects that spill over intoother time periods.\\nA conventional Harberger (1971) analysis is used to separate the welfare effects of each\\ncomponent of the projects, where this allows us to isolate the social benefits from extrapublic goods and the social costs of the tax changes made to fund their production costs.\\n6\\nBy doing so we obtain measures of the marginal social cost of public funds for each tax;\\nthese are used as scaling coefficients on revenue transfers made by the government to bal-ance its budget. For a distorting tax, each dollar of revenue raised will reduce private sur-plus by more than a dollar due to the excess burden of taxation, where the marginal socialcost of public funds exceeds unity. When taxes are Ramsey optimal they have the same mar-ginal social cost of public funds, where the welfare effects of the projects are independentof the tax used.\\nCompensated welfare measures are then used to isolate the changes in real income from\\neach project, where a compensated gain is surplus real income generated at unchangedexpected utility for every consumer. They are efficiency effects that ultimately determine thefinal changes in expected utility. We demonstrate this by generalizing the Hatta (1977)decomposition to allow variable producer prices and uncertainty. It solves actual changes inexpected utility as compensated welfare changes multiplied by the shadow value of govern-ment revenue, where the shadow value of government revenue measures the aggregatechange in expected utility from endowing a unit of real income on the economy. Since all theincome effects are included in this scaling coefficient they play no role in project evaluationIntroduction 11', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 23}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='when consumers have the same distributional weights, and when they have different weights\\nthe distributional effects are conveniently isolated by the shadow value of government revenue.\\nMost public sector projects impact on consumption risk, where some projects are under-\\ntaken because they provide risk benefits, while for other projects the changes in risk are sideeffects. For example, governments in developing countries have frequently used commodityprice stabilization schemes to reduce consumption risk, like the rice price stabilizationscheme in Indonesia and the wool price stabilization scheme in Australia.\\n7We measure risk\\nbenefits from projects by deducting the expected compensating variation (CV) from the \\nex-ante CV . The expected CV holds constant the utility of every consumer in every time\\nperiod and every state of nature. Thus, it completely undoes the impact of each project onconsumers, including changes in their consumption risk. In contrast, the ex-ante CV holdsconstant the expected utility of every consumer but without holding their utility constant inevery state of nature. It is the amount of income we can take from consumers now withoutreversing the changes in their consumption risk from the project. When the expected CV islarger than the ex-ante CV consumers benefit from changes in consumption risk, while thereverse applies when the ex-ante CV is larger.\\nOne of the most contentious issues in project evaluation involves the choice of social dis-\\ncount rate for public projects in economies with distorted markets. Harberger (1969) and\\nSandmo and Dréze (1971) find the social discount rate is a weighted average of the pre-andpost-tax interest rates in the presence of a tax on capital income in a two-period certaintysetting. By including additional time periods, Marglin (1963a, 1963b) finds it should behigher than the weighted average formula, while Bradford (1975) finds it should be approx-imately equal to the after-tax interest rate. Sjaastad and Wisecarver (1977) show how theseclaims can be reconciled by their different treatment of capital depreciation. When privatesaving rises to replace depreciation of public capital the discount rate becomes the weightedaverage formula in a multi-period setting. Others argue there are differences between privateand social discount rates when project net cash flows are uncertain. Samuelson (1964),Vickery (1964) and Arrow and Lind (1970) argue the social discount rate should be lowerbecause the government can raise funds at lower risk. Bailey and Jensen (1972) argue theseclaims are based on the public sector being able to overcome distortions in private marketsfor trading risk.\\nWe derive the social discount rate by including a tax on capital income in the public good\\neconomy. This extends the analysis of Harberger and of Sandmo and Dréze where, in theabsence of trade taxes, the weighted average formula holds in each state of nature. Oncetrade taxes are included, the social discount rate deviates from this formula when publicinvestment impacts on trade tax revenue. The derivations of the discount rate by Marglin andBradford are reconciled to the weighted average formula using the analysis in Sjaastad andWisecarver.\\n1.2 Concluding remarks\\nFinancial economics is a challenging subject because it draws together analysis from anumber of fields in economics. Indeed, modern macroeconomic analysis uses general equi-librium models with money and financial securities in a multi-period setting with uncer-tainty. Time and risk are fundamental characteristics of the environment every consumerfaces. In recent years activity in capital markets has expanded dramatically to provide consumers with opportunities to trade risk and choose their intertemporal consumption.12 Introduction', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 24}),\n",

And by reducing trading costs they expand the aggregate consump-tion opportunities for the economy. Others specialize in trading insurance so that consumerscan reduce individual risk from their consumption. While most finance courses focus onprivate activity, which is understandable given the desire students have to either work inprivate firms or as policy analysts with an understanding of how private markets function,there are nonetheless a number of important issues that are peculiar to the evaluation ofpublic policy in economies with distorted markets.\\nThis book attempts to identify fundamental principles that underpin activity in financial\\nmarkets.

For example, the capital assetpricing model makes much more sense, and can be used in a more informed way, when itis derived using standard demand–supply analysis. It helps us understand why consumersall hold the same risky bundles and why they price risk identically, as well as exposing theimportant role of the key assumptions made in the model.Introduction 13', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 25}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='2 Investment decisions \\nunder certainty\\nA lot of important insights are obtained from the standard consumer problem of an individual\\nwho maximizes utility by allocating a given amount of money income to a bundle of goodswith benefits confined to the current period. In practice, however, most goods generatefuture consumption flows, and consumers regularly make choices to determine their futureconsumption by trading capital goods. Houses and cars are obvious examples of goods withfuture consumption flows, as are jars of honey or packets of biscuits. These goods are cap-ital assets which, broadly defined, are goods that embody future consumption flows. Theycan be purchased from current income as a form of saving, or by borrowing against futureincome. Either way, they allow consumers to trade intertemporally.\\n1\\nThere are different ways of shifting consumption through time: some result from actions\\nconsumers take in isolation, such as storage and other private investment activities, whileothers arise from trading in the capital market. In Section 2.1 we follow the analysis inHirshleifer (1965) by examining storage and other private investment opportunities in anautarky economy where consumers live in isolation on (imaginary) island economies. This\\nconveniently separates capital investment undertaken directly by individuals themselvesfrom investment made on their behalf by firms. Individuals can store goods, such as rice andapples, for future consumption, and they can also plant rice and apple trees to produce futureconsumption. Both are examples of private investment in capital assets. Additional oppor-tunities arise when they can trade capital assets with each other in the capital market .\\n2\\nThe role of trade is examined in Section 2.2 by introducing it in stages. Atemporal trade\\nis introduced to the autarky economy where consumers exchange goods in each time periodbut not over time. This first step conveniently allows us to summarize intertemporal con-sumption choices using dollar values of expenditure in each period. It is the basis for thestandard Fisher (1930) analysis of intertemporal consumption choices over current andfuture expenditure. Since consumers equate the marginal utility from spending (real)income on each good in their bundle, the composition of the consumption bundle can besuppressed in the analysis. Fiat money (currency) is then included to identify its role as amedium of exchange, and we do this by initially ruling out currency as a store of value,where the demand for currency is determined by its ability to reduce trading costs in eachtime period. The final extension allows consumers to also trade across time periods in amarket economy , where some save while others borrow due to differences in their prefer-\\nences, income flows and /or the rate of interest (which equates aggregate borrowing andsaving in a competitive capital market). These intertemporal transfers can be made withoutaffecting aggregate consumption. It only requires consumers to have different marginal val-uations for future relative to current consumption. And there is even greater scope to trade', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 26}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='intertemporally when aggregate consumption can be transferred into the future through stor-\\nage and other forms of investment.\\nFinancial securities play a number of important roles in market economies, one of which\\nis to reduce the costs of trading private property rights over resources. Most finance modelsignore these costs because they are relatively small, but that diminishes their importance,particularly when there is uncertainty and asymmetric information between traders whereproperty rights are more costly to trade. In a certainty setting with complete information, no transactions costs, and perfectly divisible capital goods, there is no role for financialsecurities. In reality, however, goods are not perfectly divisible and they are costly to moveabout, and financial securities, and in particular fiat money, can dramatically lower thesecosts by reducing the number of physical exchanges of goods and services. Without finan-cial assets consumers would exchange goods numerous times before finally converting theminto their preferred consumption bundle. Since these assets provide holders with claims tounderlying real resources, they reduce the number of times goods are transferred betweenconsumers. When financial securities trade in a market economy we refer to it as an asset\\neconomy .\\nTrading costs are introduced to the asset economy to illustrate what determines the \\noptimal demand for financial securities in a certainty setting. These costs arise on atempo-ral and intertemporal trades, where different securities play different roles in reducing them.Fiat money is a liquid security used for relatively low-valued transactions, and is more widely accepted by traders. Its role as a store of value is undermined somewhat by the non-payment of interest on currency held for a period of time, so its primary role is asa medium of exchange. Consumers do carry currency between periods as a form of insur-ance when there is uncertainty, but most intertemporal trade is facilitated using financialsecurities. For example, firms issue bonds and shares to fund investment, particularly larger investments with economies of scale. These securities specify the terms and conditions that govern the resource transfers through time. In practice the most significantdifference between bonds and shares, and the many other financial securities that trade, is the risk in their payouts. Indeed, a key role of financial securities is to facilitate trades over risky resource transfers, and we examine this in much greater detail in Chapters 3 and 4. In a certainty setting, however, financial securities summarize property right trans-fers between savers and borrowers, where savers forgo current consumption in return for future consumption, while the reverse applies for borrowers. In effect, the security is acontract that specifies the terms and conditions that govern these intertemporal resourcetransfers.\\nThey also provide a mechanism for aligning (at least partially) the incentives of firm man-\\nagers (as agents) to the interests of their investors (the principals). The task is greatly sim-plified when investors all have the same objective function for firms. Irving Fisher (1930)made the important observation that consumers make their investment and intertemporalconsumption choices separately when they are price-takers. In particular, they chooseinvestment to maximize wealth and then choose intertemporal consumption to maximizeutility. This is referred to as the Fisher separation theorem , and it provides price-taking\\nfirms with the simple and unanimous objective by its investors to maximize profit. Wedemonstrate this theorem and consider how economic analysis is affected when it fails tohold. The firm’ s objective function is much more complicated when Fisher separation breaksdown because investment choices depend on the intertemporal consumption preferences ofits investors. Financial securities play an important role in aligning the interests of managerswith those of their investors when there is uncertainty and asymmetric infor mation.

Also, specialist traders in the financial market gather information to identify profitableopportunities when share prices deviate from their fundamental determinants. On someoccasions they purchase enough shares to change the way a firm operates by reorganizingor replacing its existing management, by merging it with another firm, or by liquidating itsassets and closing it down entirely. That is why share prices provide important signals, notjust about conditions that affect the underlying value of goods and services that firms pro-duce, but also about the performance of their managers. Share prices fall when tradersbelieve managers are performing poorly, and this acts as a discipline on them. Conversely,managers who perform well benefit their shareholders by driving up share prices. Indeed,share prices, and changes in them, provide important information to traders in capital markets.\\nExpected inflation in the general price level can affect capital asset values by changing\\ntheir real economic returns. These real effects originate in a number of different ways so westart by initially demonstrating the Fisher effect in Section 2.3. It is where nominal assetreturns move with fully anticipated inflation to preserve their real returns, and it arises in aclassical finance model where all nominal variables adjust freely in frictionless competitivemarkets and traders have common information. This establishes an important benchmark foridentifying the real effects of inflation when the key assumptions in the model are relaxed.In particular, we consider heterogeneous expectations and the wealth effects from the non-payment of interest on currency.\\nArbitrage in competitive (frictionless) markets underpins all of the popular asset pricing\\nmodels in finance. Indeed, it makes every security (in the same risk class) pay the sameexpected economic return in every time period, and makes any sequence of short rates ofreturn consistent with the corresponding long rate of return over the same period. Wedemonstrate these propositions in Section 2.4 by pricing bonds and shares, and then usethese prices to derive the Modigliani −Miller financial policy irrelevance theorems in the\\npresence of taxes in a two-period certainty model. This analysis is extended later in Chapters 3and 4 to accommodate uncertainty.\\n2.1 Intertemporal consumption in autarky\\nFisher (1930) initially showed that price-taking agents use the net present value (NPV) ruleto value capital assets when they can trade intertemporally in a competitive capital market.Before demonstrating this we start the analysis in an autarky economy to identify where thepotential gains from trade come from in market economies.

But without intertemporal trade they can have different marginal valuations for goodsbetween time periods, in which case they will use different discount rates on future con-sumption flows when valuing capital assets. We assume all trades within each period are atcompetitively determined equilibrium commodity prices, where p\\nt: ={1, ... , pt(N)}is the set\\nof relative prices for the Ngoods at time with good 1 chosen as numeraire.

Any combination of the Ngoods can be purchased in each time period, subject\\nto consumption expenditure being no greater than the market value of the endowments.

There are occasions where consumers invest in education to achieve higher job satisfaction rather than higher wages, but we will abstract from thatissue here.\\nUsing the production technology defined earlier in the autarky economy, the market value\\nof output in the second period for each consumer is which is produced by inputs in the first period with a market value of Onceagain, we assume the production opportunity set is strictly convex, where the problem foreach consumer in the asset economy with private investment is summarized in (2.5) whenincome in each period is defined as\\n(2.10)\\nIX V Z\\nI X aR Y00 0 0\\n11 1 1≡− −\\n≡+ +,\\n.Zp n z nh\\nnh\\n00 0≡∑ () () .Yp n y nh\\nnh\\n11 1≡∑ () () ,Investment decisions under certainty 31\\nDefinition 2.6 An asset economy with private investment opportunities is described by ( u, y\\n(H),a), where y(H) is the set of private production opportunities for the Hconsumers.

There arealso Jfirms that perform the important task of moving resources to future time periods,\\nwhere they do so at lower cost through specialization and large-scale production. To sim-plify the analysis we will assume goods are non-storable (although storage can easily beaccommodated as a part of production) and there is no private investment by consumers. Allinvestment is undertaken by firms who finance it by selling securities to consumers in thefirst period. In the second period they sell their output and use the proceeds to repurchasetheir securities from consumers. There is no government in the economy at this stage, so theonly traders in the capital and goods markets are private agents. In many of the financeapplications we examine in following chapters very little insight is gained by including production. For example, when deriving prices for assets with uncertain future returns wewant to know how they are affected by risk-spreading opportunities provided in the capitalmarket for risk-averse consumers. By including production we allow the supply of riskysecurities to change endogenously, but that adds little to the derivations of equilibrium assetpricing equations unless it provides new risk-spreading opportunities not already availableto consumers using existing securities. Production is much more important in project eval-uation where welfare changes depend on actual equilibrium outcomes. For that reason weinclude production in the asset economy, where the consumer problem is summarized in(2.8) when income in each period is defined as\\n(2.11)\\nwhere is the set of profit shares in each firm j. Production by private\\nfirms is the only way resources can be transferred intertemporally in this economy withoutstorage and private investment.

Trading costs drive wedges between bor-rowing and lending rates, and this can in some circumstances cause the theorem to fail. Theimportant practical implication of this theorem is that all shareholders are unanimous inwanting firms to maximize profit. Indeed, once this objective is assigned to firms it invokesthe conditions required for Fisher separation on the economic analysis. It is much easier forthe capital market to create incentives for firm managers to act in the interests of their share-holders when their objective is to maximize profit. Mergers and takeovers are a threat tomanagers who do not maximize profit because their share prices are lower than they couldbe with better management.\\nFigure 2.10 is the familiar analysis in Hirshleifer (1970) that is used to illustrate the Fisher\\nseparation theorem in a two-period certainty model with production by firms.

In circumstances like this the objective function of the firm cannot be solved inde-\\npendently of the preferences of its investors, where some type of voting mechanism isneeded to trade off their competing gains and losses.\\nThis conflict also applies more generally. Whenever a firm is able to affect the prices of\\nits inputs and/or outputs it can have income and substitution effects on investors when theyalso consume the firm’ s output or supply its inputs. By way of example, consider a single-price monopolist whose investors consume its output. When it restricts output to make profitby driving up the product price, its investors are made better off by the higher profit butworse off by the higher product price. The relative costs and benefits depend on how muchcapital they invest in the firm relative to the value of the good consumed. Typically weassume investors in a single-price monopolist do not consume its product, or when they dothey consume such a small amount that price changes have a negligible impact on their realincome, where profit maximization is their unanimous objective function for the firm’ smanagers.\\nA number of private and public institutions play an important role in supporting the Fisher\\nseparation theorem. Publicly listed companies are threatened by mergers and takeovers thathelp to align the interests of firm managers with those of their shareholders. Also, compa-nies write contracts with managers that provide them with incentives to act in the interestsof shareholders. For example, managers are frequently required to hold a portion of theirwealth in the firm’ s shares or to hold call options written on them. They also include penal-tiesfor managers who do not perform. There are public regulations which specify the mini-\\nmum information that firm managers must provide investors with, and competition policyis used to restrict the market power of firms. All these problems arise because investors donot have complete information about the actions taken on their behalf by firm managers.Traders in financial markets specialize in monitoring firms and will exploit any potentialprofits from replacing managers who under-perform. As specialists they perform this monitoring role at lower cost than investors would incur by monitoring firm managersthemselves.\\n2.2.6 Asset economy with investment by firms and fiat money\\nThere is no role for currency as a store of value in a certainty setting without trading costs\\nwhen there is a risk-free security that pays interest. Due to the non-payment of interest oncurrency the opportunity cost of holding it over time is the forgone interest that could havebeen earned by holding the security instead. Currency was introduced to the endowmenteconomy in Section 2.2.2 when it could be used as a medium of exchange to reduce costsof atemporal trade in each time period, but not as a store of value. In practice, currency hasproperties that make it a more effective medium of exchange, particularly for some trades,than a financial security, and we captured this previously by assuming they had differentimpacts on trading costs. While this explains why consumers use currency in each period, itdoes not explain why they use it as a store of value when no interest is paid. Any incometransferred into the future would generate a larger consumption flow by using the risk-freesecurity. On that basis, consumers would use currency in each period as a medium of exchange but not hold it over time unless there are other benefits from doing so.

The widely used equilibrium asset pricing models, which weexamine in Chapter 4, assume there are no trading costs. But they have to be included toexplain the demand for currency and the separate but related role for using financial secu-rities rather than forward contracts. Indeed, financial securities are a less costly way to sum-marize the property right transfers when consumers trade intertemporally. A financialsecurity that transfers income between the two periods is preferable to forward contractsbecause only one asset is exchanged (in a certainty setting), whereas a number of forwardcontracts are exchanged for goods and they must specify the quality, time and quantity ofeach good to be traded in the future. Thus, there are transactions costs benefits from usingthe risk-free asset which are likely to drive wedges between the discount rates consumer useto evaluate future consumption flows.

The analysisin this section provides us with a way to think about how results in following sections maychange when trading costs are included.\\n2.3 Asset prices and inflation\\nAsset prices change when inflation affects their expected real returns. Governments deter-mine nominal price inflation in their economies by controlling the rate of growth in thenominal money supply. Money prices do not change over time if the money supply grows atthe same rate as money demand.\\n24However, it is not a trivial task for governments to match\\nthese growth rates, particularly when there is uncertainty about future outcomes. Moneydemand can be quite difficult to determine, especially in periods when there are large realshocks in economic activity. For example, the effects of large increases in the price of oilwill depend on whether they are expected to be persistent or transitory, and are difficult topredict because people adjust to them over time. Moreover, governments have direct controlover fiat money (notes and coins), but not broadly measured money, which includes chequeand other interest-bearing deposit accounts issued by both public and private financial inter-mediaries. Most governments control the broad money base by adjusting the quantity of cur-rency on issue and by regulating the liquidity ratios of the assets held by financialinstitutions who create non-fiat money. They also intervene in bond markets to change interestrates when, in the absence of capital controls, domestic and foreign bonds are not perfectsubstitutes.\\nAt the present time most developed countries have annual rates of general price inflation\\naround 2 −3 per cent. The rates of inflation are much higher in some developing countries,\\nas they were in many developed countries during the 1970s and 1980s. There are costs andbenefits of inflation. Some costs arise from the interaction between inflation and the taxsystem, while others arise from the income redistribution that takes place when inflationcauses relative prices to change due to rigidities in nominal variables. For example, consumers with fixed money incomes lose from higher goods prices, while governmentsbenefit from collecting revenue as seigniorage from the non-payment of interest on currency.\\nThis section examines the way general price inflation affects current asset prices.

If we assume, for the moment at\\nleast, that the net cash flows rise at the inflation rate, the change in the asset price will bedetermined by the way the nominal interest rate changes. This is confirmed by using theidentity that defines the relationship between the nominal and real interest rates:\\n(2.18)\\nIf the inflation rate is expected to rise we have the following possibilities:\\ni the nominal interest rate can rise with an unchanged real interest rate, where this leaves\\nthe asset price in (2.17) unchanged;\\nii the nominal interest rate can stay constant and the real interest rate falls, where the asset\\nprice in (2.17) rises due to the lower opportunity cost of time;\\niii the nominal and real interest rates can both change when the nominal rate rises by less\\nthan the inflation rate, where the lower real rate causes the asset price in (2.17) to rise,but by less than it would have with an unchanged nominal interest rate.\\n2.3.1 The Fisher effect\\nUltimately the relationship between the nominal interest rate and the expected rate of inflation\\nwill depend on the way the economy adjusts to expected inflation.

It means anticipated changes in the money supply have no realeffects in these circumstances. However, there is empirical evidence from some countriesthat nominal interest rates will rise with the rate of inflation over a long period of time.And this happens in economies where nominal interest payments are subject to distortingtaxes so that the tax-adjusted Fisher effect needs to be even higher.\\n28However, it is\\nunlikely to hold in the short term or in economies where the conditions above do notapply. The most useful aspect of this analysis is that it provides a way of understandingwhat factors determine the real effects of expected inflation outside the classical financemodel.\\nWe now consider what happens when the first three conditions in the classical model out-\\nlined above are relaxed. The role of taxes will be examined in more detail in later chapters.If there are rigidities in more than one nominal variable in the economy then inflation canhave real effects that will cause the Fisher effect to fail. In a Keynesian macroeconomicmodel with rigid money wages, monetary policy has real effects by altering the real wage andemployment. Suppose a minimum wage leads to involuntary unemployment in the economywhere an increase in the rate of growth in the money supply can raise aggregate output bypushing up the nominal prices of goods and services and reducing real wages.\\n29Clearly, this\\nstimulus in activity will be reversed when minimum wages are later adjusted to preserve themin real terms.\\n30Any resulting changes in capital asset prices are determined by equilibrium\\nadjustments to the relative prices of goods and services and the real interest rate, which canbe estimated by using a computable general equilibrium model of the economy.\\nWhen agents form different expectations about the rate of inflation they expect different\\nreal interest rates, and this impacts on the capital market. By way of illustration, supposeborrowers expect a higher rate of inflation than do savers, with π\\nB>πS. Since both face a\\ncommon nominal interest rate when negotiating security trades, they must have differentreal interest rates which are solved using (2.18) as:\\n(2.20)\\nwith r\\nB<rS. This difference means borrowers are prepared to raise the nominal interest rate\\nmore than savers require to preserve their real return. The equilibrium nominal interest ratesimultaneously raises the real return to savers and lowers the real cost of capital forinvestors, where the implicit interest rate subsidy is illustrated in Figure 2.13.\\nThe lower real interest rate for borrowers causes capital asset prices to rise in the first\\nperiod. Clearly, the reverse applies when savers expect a higher rate of inflation because theywould want the nominal interest rate to rise more to preserve their real return than borrowerscould afford to pay. This would act like an implicit tax on the capital market by driving downthe equilibrium level of investment and saving.\\n31111 11+= +( )+( )=+( )+( ) ir rBB SS ππ ,η011\\n001jj\\njpy\\nipz =+−∀ ,Xi11/( ),+Investment decisions under certainty 43', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 55}),\n",

The\\nprivate cost of holding currency is the nominal interest rate forgone on interest-bearingassets (with the same risk as currency). There are two components to this opportunity cost −\\none is the real interest return on bonds, while the other is the loss of purchasing power ofcurrency due to inflation. If, as is normally the case, the social marginal cost of supplyingcurrency is less than the nominal interest rate, then the non-payment of interest will imposea welfare loss on currency holders. In effect, they face a tax equal to the difference betweenthe nominal interest rate and the marginal production cost which imposes a welfare loss onthem. And this loss increases when higher expected inflation pushes up the nominal interestrate and reduces currency demand even further. Thus, changes in expected inflation havereal effects on consumers that undermine the Fisher effect.\\nThis welfare loss from the non-payment of interest on currency is illustrated in Figure 2.14,\\nwhere the aggregate demand ( m\\nd) for and supply ( ms) of real money balances are defined\\nhere as the nominal value of the notes and coins held by consumers divided by the consumerprice index (CPI). For illustrative purposes we assume the marginal social cost of supplyingcurrency ( mc\\ns) is zero. In practice, however, it is positive but much smaller than the nomi-\\nnal interest rate. Initially the nominal interest rate i0equates money demand and supply,\\nwhere the CPI is expected to rise at the same rate as the nominal money supply (broadlydefined) in the next period of time.\\nReal money demand is determined by the marginal benefits consumers get from using \\ncurrency, which for the most part is determined by the amount it reduces their trading costs as amedium of exchange and is therefore an increasing function of real income ( y). Consumers max-\\nimize utility by equating their marginal benefits from using currency to the nominal interest rate,where the welfare loss is the cross-lined triangular region in Figure 2.14; it is a dollar measure ofthe forgone benefits due to the non-payment of interest.

Between these times tradersnegotiate discounts on trades made with currenc y as compen sation for accrued interest.\\nIndeed, this practice could be implemented by embedding  computer chips in notes and(possibly) coins to record accrued interest and compute any discounts on trade betweeninterest payments. Many supporters of private currency argue it removes the incentive forgovernments to use inflation as a hidden tax on consumers to finance their expenditure. Butin recent times most governments have maintained low rates of inflation to minimize itsadverse real effects on the economy, and this has mitigated, at least partially, the attractionof private currency.\\n35\\nIn summary, the way expected inflation affects capital asset prices depends on the real\\neffects it has on the private economy.

Occasionally they have very high values that suggest the shares will payvery low returns. For example, information technology (IT) stocks had measured P/E ratiosas high as 60 during the IT boom at the end of the twentieth century. But this is explained bythe low measured earnings in periods of research and development which do not include theexpected capital gains included in economic income. Sometimes the reported P/E ratios arenegative due to income losses. However, current share prices are determined by expected eco-nomic income, which cannot be negative.

There are basically two methods that can be used:straight line and diminishing value. But it is not uncommon for these asset prices to risein some time periods. For example, firms with land and buildings in the central businessdistricts of major cities frequently make capital gains on these assets even though theyapply depreciation allowances to them when computing measured income. Moreover,there are circumstances where every physical asset depreciates in value while the overallmarket value of the firm appreciates. This occurs in periods when intangible assets suchas goodwill are created, or when investments are made in activities that are expected topay economic profits in the future. All these capital gains are included in economic depre-ciation (with Φ\\nt>0), while they are only included in measured income at the time the\\nintangible assets actually trade. For example, when firms sell land and buildings they canreport any capital gains at the time of sale, and not in the period when they actually occur.This makes measured income less than economic income in periods when the gains occur,but greater than economic income in periods when the assets are traded and the gains realized.\\nSecond, since measured depreciation is based on initial prices paid for assets it is called\\nhistoric cost depreciation , and it underestimates economic depreciation when there is\\ngeneral price inflation. The best way to illustrate this point is to consider the way eco-nomic depreciation in (2.34) is affected by anticipated inflation. Consider a situationwhere all nominal variables rise at the expected rate of inflation ( π) to preserve the real\\neconomy. By using (2.18) we can write the expected nominal economic income on equityin (2.32) as:\\nwhere the net cash flows and value of the firm at time trise by the expected rate of infla-\\ntion.

In the presence of uncertainty, however, changes in the debt −\\nequity ratio (with investment held constant) can affect the returns to debt and equity by moving risk between them, but without affecting the overall value of the firm when there is common information. This is examined later in Chapter 7 by including uncertaintyin the analysis.

       " Document(page_content='3 Uncertainty and risk\\nConsumption goods in a certainty setting are characterized by their type (physical \\nattributes), geographic location and location in time. For example, an apple in one locationis different from an apple (with the same physical attributes) in another location, and it isalso different from the same apple in different time periods. Indeed, consumers derive utility from the combination of characteristics that define them, which for an apple, includesweetness, size, colour, firmness and moisture content. In fact, it is possible to estimate theprice of any good as the summed value of its characteristics using hedonic prices, which areconsumer marginal valuations for each characteristic.\\n1Uncertainty introduces randomness\\ninto future consumption through exogenous variability in the environment within whichconsumers live. Its effects may be confined to the variance it imparts to their consumptionor a combination of that and its direct impact on their utility. Debreu (1959) captures uncertainty by expanding the characteristics used to define consumption goods by makingthem state-contingent, where all possible future states of the world are defined by uniquecombinations of a set of environmental variables. Consumers choose future consumptionbundles that are contingent upon the realization of a final state of the world. In effect, theypre-commit to trades in specified states, where uncertainty is resolved when the true stateeventuates.\\n2This is the state-preference approach to uncertainty that extends a standard \\ncertainty analysis by expanding the commodity space to include goods that are state-contingent. When consumers with common beliefs about the outcomes in each state ofnature can trade goods in competitive frictionless markets in each time period, over time andbetween states of the world, the familiar Pareto optimality conditions apply.\\nIn the Debreu model consumers trade a full set of contingent commodity contracts which\\nare commitments to exchange goods in specified states at agreed terms of trade. To make it astraightforward extension of the certainty model summarized in Definition 2.3, consumershave conditional perfect foresight and correctly anticipate equilibrium outcomes in each stateof the world. In particular, every consumer correctly predicts their income and all the commodity prices. The only uncertainty is about which state becomes the actual (or true) state.In this setting the number of forward commodity contracts must increase to Ntimes the\\nnumber of possible states of the world so that consumers can trade all Ncommodities in every\\nstate.\\n3Arrow (1953) extends the Debreu model by including risky financial securities so that\\nconsumers can transfer income (and consumption) between states by bundling securities intoportfolios. In the Arrow–Debreu economy there are no transactions costs, the capital market is\\ncomplete, and traders are price-takers with conditional perfect foresight. That makes it fullyequivalent to the asset economy with certainty, summarized earlier in Definition 2.4. In a com-\\nplete capital market consumers can trade every commodity in every state, where, in theabsence of taxes and other market distortions, they equate their marginal valuations for goods.', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 83}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Uncertainty provides an explanation for the large number of different types of securities that\\ntrade in capital markets. Consumers bundle them together in portfolios to choose patterns ofconsumption expenditure over uncertain states of nature. Indeed, in a complete capital market there are enough securities for them to trade in every state and spread risk according totheir preferences. Financial securities play two important roles in spreading risk. The first is to eliminate diversifiable (individual) risk from consumption expenditure, while the \\nsecond is to transfer non-diversifiable (market) risk across consumers. Whenever production\\nactivities in the economy are less than perfectly correlated, some of the variability in their netcash flows can be eliminated by bundling the securities used to finance them inside well-diversified portfolios. Consumers also face idiosyncratic (or individual ) risk in their \\nconsumption expenditure that can be diversified across the population. For example, a given proportion of consumers will suffer a car accident and be harmed by adverse weather conditions. By purchasing insurance they create pools of funds for paying claims madeby those incurring losses. Whenever individual risk trades at actuarially fair prices it is costlessly eliminated from consumption, where non-diversifiable risk is the only risk that will cause asset prices to sell at a discount in a frictionless competitive capital market. This is a fundamental property of all the popular asset pricing models we look at inChapter 4.\\n4\\nFinancial securities facilitate the efficient transfer of market risk to consumers with lower\\nrelative risk aversion and/or better information. A large proportion of aggregate investmentis financed by shares and bonds that consumers hold either directly in their own securityportfolios or indirectly in mutual funds that are portfolios created by financial intermediaries. Indeed, a range of derivative securities are created to eliminate diversifiablerisk from consumption and trade market risk at lower cost. For example, there are futurescontracts for most major commodities that allow producers to reduce their exposure to priceuncertainty on their outputs and inputs. Aluminium, crude oil, petroleum, wheat, wool, rice,sugar and coffee are all examples of commodities with futures contracts. Buyers give sellers a commitment to pay a set price for the delivery of a specified quantity and qual-ity of a commodity at a specified point in time. Options contracts give holders the right, but not the obligation, to trade commodities and financial securities at specified prices onor before a specified time. They are used to replicate existing securities and to trade market risk.\\nA major objective of finance research is to derive an asset pricing model where \\nevery consumer measures and prices risk in the same way. It is used by private traders tovalue risky projects and by agencies in the public sector to evaluate the effects of government policies. Many traders in financial markets are specialists who collect information about the net cash flows on capital assets to identify securities with prices thatdo not fully reflect their fundamentals. By selling securities with high prices (relative totheir fundamentals), and buying securities with low prices, they make profits through arbi-trage. When these profits are eliminated the no arbitrage condition holds so that security\\nprices reflect all available information about their fundamentals. Pricing models are alsoused in project evaluation by private firms and public agencies. Private firms seek profitableinvestment opportunities, while government agencies examine policy changes and publicprojects that will raise social welfare. But these two objectives rarely coincide in economieswith distorted markets due to, for example, taxes, externalities and non-competitive behaviour.\\n5\\nIn this chapter we examine the role of uncertainty and risk on equilibrium outcomes in \\nprivate market economies – in particular, how it affects capital asset prices.

       " Document(page_content='distinguished between risk and uncertainty by identifying risk as circumstances where \\nconsumers assign numerical probabilities to random events, and uncertainty as circumstanceswhere they do not (or cannot) assign such probabilities. The analysis commences in Section3.1 by looking at consumer preferences under uncertainty and risk, starting with the generalized state preferences employed in the Arrow–Debreu economy. We then consider theexpected utility approach that separates probabilities from utility at each random event. Thiswas initially formalized by von Neumann and Morgenstern (1944) using common (objective)probabilities with state-independent consumption preferences. A large literature generalizestheir approach by allowing different (subjective) probabilities and/or state-dependent consumption preferences. Despite the appeal of these extensions, however, the von\\nNeumann–Morgenstern expected utility (NMEU) function is much more widely used in \\neconomic analysis because of its simplicity. Finally we consider mean–variance analysis as a\\nspecial case of the expected utility approach. This is used in the four asset pricing modelsexamined later in Chapter 4.\\nIn Section 3.1 we derive an asset pricing equation in the two-period state-preference\\nmodel of Arrow and Debreu where consumers have conditional perfect foresight based on\\ncommon beliefs about the state-contingent commodity prices. This is a certainty-equivalentanalysis that naturally extends the asset pricing model derived in the two-period certaintyeconomy with production in Section 2.2.4. The Arrow–Debreu pricing model accounts for\\nuncertainty in asset prices without explicitly isolating the probabilities consumers assign torandom events. We modify this model in Section 3.2 by adopting (NMEU) functions to separate probabilities assigned to random events from the utility consumers derive fromtheir expenditure in each event. This allows us to derive the consumption-based pricing\\nmodel (CBPM) where in equilibrium consumers have the same consumption risk in a \\nfrictionless competitive capital market. Thus, we can summarize it using the set of common factors that explain the risk in aggregate consumption. The four popular asset pricing models examined in Chapter 4 differ by the way they isolate these commonfactors.\\n3.1 State-preference theory\\nDebreu made a very important contribution to standard general equilibrium analysis underuncertainty by expanding the definition of commodities to make them event-contingent. Itis generally referred to as the state-preference approach to uncertainty.\\n3.1.1 The (finite) state space\\nSavage (1954) provides widely accepted definitions for the basic concepts of the theory of\\nchoice under uncertainty in the state-preference model, where a state is a complete description\\nof all relevant aspects of the world, a true state is the one that actually eventuates when the\\nuncertainty is resolved, while an event is a set of states. We assume the set of possible state \\nS:={1,…,S} and the number of time periods Tare finite.6At each time t=0,1, ... , Tthere is\\na partition tof the state space S, whose elements are events that can occur at that time.7\\nEach event is a subset of the states in Sand is outside the control of consumers. Consumers\\nface most uncertainty in the first period where partition 0has one event containing all \\nthe possible states of nature that can eventuate in the last time period T; this is the coarsest \\npartition of S.

We can summarize the properties of the state\\nspace as follows:\\niSis exhaustive – it contains all possible states of the world.\\nii All s ∈ Sare mutually exclusive – the occurrence of one state rules out the occur-\\nrence of any other state.\\niii Every state s ∈ Sis independent of the actions of consumers – both as individu-\\nals or as coalitions.\\niv All consumers agree on sand classify every state in the same way.\\nv All consumers agree on the true state of the world in period T.\\nBy conditions (i) and (ii) the state space identifies every possible description of the \\nenvironment in the second period where each state is unique.

Thus, in the presence of uncertainty they aredefined by their physical attributes, their geographic location and by contingent events.\\nIn a two-period analysis where uncertainty is completely resolved in the second period it\\nmakes more sense to define goods as state-contingent, rather than event-contingent, as thesingle event in \\n0contains all the states, while there are as many events as states in 1. We\\nadopt this terminology in the following analysis which is undertaken in a two-period setting.Consumer beliefs must clearly play an important role in determining equilibrium outcomeswhen there is uncertainty. With incomplete information they can have subjective probabili-ties that deviate from the true underlying objective probabilities. Further, consumers with\\ndifferent information can have different subjective probabilities.\\n9It is clear from the event\\ntree in Figure 3.1 that a considerable amount of information has to be processed to solve theevent-contingent prices for each good, especially in the first period where all states are pos-sible outcomes in the final period.\\nEach consumer must implicitly solve all the event-contingent commodity prices along\\neach branch of the tree by computing the demands and supplies of every good in each state.In the following analysis we characterize equilibrium outcomes in the state-preferencemodel when consumers have conditional perfect foresight.\\nIf, in these circumstances, they can trade event-contingent claims for every commodity in\\nevery future time period the optimality conditions in a competitive equilibrium will havesimilar properties to those we are more familiar with in a certainty setting without taxes andtrading costs. In particular, it will be a Pareto optimal allocation where consumers use thesame event-contingent discount factors to value future consumption.

There are no financial securities ormoney so consumers and producers instead exchange event-contingent claims to goods.These are forward contracts that specify the delivery of a unit of a commodity at a given\\nlocation contingent on the occurrence of a specified event, with current prices determinedby the event-contingent commodity prices. We initially restrict the analysis to two time periods and adapt the endowment economy in Section 2.2.3 by including production andexpanding the commodity space to make goods state-contingent in the second period. In thefirst period each consumer ( h =1, ... , H) now chooses a bundle of future consumption goods\\nthat trade in competitive markets at expected future spot prices p\\ns: =\\n{ps(1), ... , ps(N)} in each state s. They do this to maximize a generalized utility function\\nwhere is the current consumption bundle.11We assume consumers\\nhave conditional perfect foresight when they trade forward commodity contracts\\nat the state-contingent prices pfs: ={pfs(1), ... , pfs(N)}, where fs(n)\\n> 0 is the amount of good ndelivered to the consumer, and fs(n) < 0 the amount sold, in state s.ff f Nsh\\nsh\\nsh : { ( ), ... , ( )}= 1xh\\n0 ux x xhh h\\nsh (, ,... , ),01x xx Nsh\\nsh\\nsh : { ( ),..., ( )}= 1Uncertainty and risk 75\\nDefinition 3.1 (Conditional perfects foresight)\\nConsumers with conditional perfect foresight have common beliefs and correctly predict the\\ncommodity prices in each state of the world, with for all h. ppsh\\ns=', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 87}),\n",

For most individual risk there is good informa-tion about the probabilities of payouts, and when it is the only source of income uncertaintyNMEU seems appropriate. But income is also subject to aggregate uncertainty about thestates of nature, where consumers are much more likely to assign different probabilities tostates, particularly when they have different information because it is costly to obtain.\\n27\\nSavage (1954) and Anscombe and Aumann (1963) recognize this by deriving the subjective\\nexpected utility (SEU) function Eh{U(I~)}. This assigns subjective probabilities to states of\\nnature and uses a state-independent utility function to assess the benefits from consumptionexpenditure. Additional behavioural postulates are required for this function, which includethe sure-thing principle that extends the independence axiom to state-contingent outcomes,\\nand conditions to describe the way consumers form their probability beliefs.\\n28This is a \\nparticularly useful extension because it isolates the role of costly information when consumers assign probabilities to states.\\nSubsequent work has argued that the SEU function should in fact be state-dependent\\nbecause the same consumption bundle in one state may not generate the same benefits inanother state. For example, consumers are unlikely to get the same benefits from a bundleof food in a state where they are healthy as they would get from the same bundle in a statewhere they are sick. Mas-Colell et al . (1995) respond to this problem by deriving a \\nstate-dependent expected utility function. They extend the NMEU function with objective\\nprobabilities by allowing state-dependent preferences, while Drèze (1987), Fishburn (1974),Grant and Karni (2004), Karni (1993) and Karni et al . (1983) derive state-dependent \\nsubjective expected utility functions. Unfortunately they all have drawbacks that result from\\ntheir different behavioural postulates. For example, Drèze gives consumers the ability todetermine states, while Fishburn has consumers making comparisons between mutually exclusive outcomes. It is a very difficult task to separate subjective probabilitiesfrom state-dependent preferences, a point that is perhaps best appreciated by noting that the expected utility function in these circumstances is If consumers have the same probabilities we can identify the role of their state-dependent preferences by evaluating expected utility with constant consumption (which is where the consumption bundle is the same in every state). Alternatively, when they have state-independent preferences we can identify their subjective state probabilities by doing the same thing. But when they have subjective probabilities and state-dependent pref-erences it is not possible to separate them without placing additional restrictions on preferences.\\nA further extension to NMEU defines consumer preferences over the mean and variance\\nin their consumption expenditure using the indirect utility function V(\\n•). Many applications\\nin economics adopt this approach to simplify the analysis. For example, all the asset pricingmodels examined in Chapter 4 use mean–variance analysis. Later in Section 3.3.3 we showthere are two ways of justifying this approach – one assigns quadratic preferences to consumers, while the other requires consumption expenditure to be a normally distributedrandom variable.

Consumers with state-independent preferences choose patternsof consumption across states based on their risk aversion, relative commodity prices and thestate probabilities. And by trading in a frictionless competitive capital market with commonprobabilities they have the same growth rates in marginal utility over time. That means consumers will face the same consumption risk, which is why the popular consumption-based pricing models we examine in Chapter 4 are functions of factors that determine aggregate consumption risk. But NMEU has obvious limitations – in particular, state-independent preferences may not be appropriate in such applications as the economics ofhealth care insurance.\\n29Once we relax state-independence and/or common objective \\nprobabilities consumers can face different consumption risk where the asset pricing equations are functions of a much larger number of factors. The behavioural postulates forthe NMEU preferences are summarized as follows:\\ni The standard preference relation (\\n/H11376) applies to rankings of consumption bundles (in the\\n(1 + S)-dimensional commodity space), where /H11376is complete, transitive and continuous.\\nii The independence axiom holds – so that common alternatives within each state are irrel-\\nevant when ranking money payoffs to lotteries. For example, the preference ranking overtwo lotteries Land L′will not be changed by combining them both with a third lottery\\nL′′. Thus, if L\\n/H11376L′then [(1 − π′′)L+π ′ ′ L′′] /H11376[(1 − π′′) L′+π′′L′′] when the independ-\\nence axiom holds.\\niii The preference relation /H11376is state-independent.\\niv Consumers assign objective probabilities to lotteries and states. \\nThere is evidence from behavioural experiments that the independence axiom is violated\\nin practice. The most widely cited example is referred to as the Allais paradox (Allais 1953)\\nwhich finds people ranking the lotteries summarized in Table 3.1 in a manner that is inconsistent with the independence axiom. Most people choose A over B and C over D, butwhen the independence axiom holds D is preferred to C (whenever A is preferred to B).VE Ih\\nIh (( ) ,)/tildenospσ86 Uncertainty and risk\\nBox 3.2 Anecdotal evidence of state-dependent preferences\\nAumann provides Savage with the example of a man whose sick wife has a 50 per cent chance\\nof surviving an operation she must undergo. He is offered a choice between betting $100 dol-lars that she will survive the operation and betting the same amount on heads in the toss of a faircoin. It is argued that he will likely choose the bet on the operation if he loves his wife, becausein the event that she dies he could win $100 on the coin toss when it is worth very much less tohim. Aumann argues this is an example of a situation where the value is state-dependent. Savageresponds by arguing it can be accommodated in a model with SEU when preferences are state-independent by making the full set of consequences from the lotteries available in every state.But that would require making comparisons between incompatible outcomes where, in theexample provided by Aumann, one outcome has the man winning $100 dollars and his wife diesin a state where she survives the operation.

Experimental studies find evidence of consumers placing more weight on bad outcomes than they do on good outcomes. Benartziand Thaler (1995) and Barberis et al. (2001) model this as loss aversion for consumers with\\nstate-independent preferences, but it may in fact be evidence that they have state-dependentpreferences. Indeed, even anecdotal evidence suggests that a significant proportion of consumption benefits do depend on states of nature, particularly with respect to personalhealth, but also the prevailing weather conditions.\\nThere is also evidence that consumers assign different subjective probabilities to states of\\nnature due to differences in their information sets. Traders in financial markets gather information about the fundamental determinants of the future payouts to securities. By specialising in particular types of securities they get information at lower cost and makeprofits – at least until the information is reflected in security prices. When the efficient markets hypothesis holds in its strongest form, security prices reflect all past and currentinformation as well as security prices in past periods. But there is evidence that profits canbe made from systematic trading rules. For example, there is a weekend effect where \\nsecurity prices fall over weekends when markets are closed, a January effect in the US where\\nsecurity prices are systematically higher at the beginning of the month, a small-firm effect\\nwhere firms with relatively low market values paid higher rates of return on average thanthe entire stock market index over the period between 1960 and 1985, and a closed end fund\\neffect where the value of mutual funds that bundle together a fixed number of shares trade\\nat lower valuations than the sum of the market valuations of their shares.\\nDespite these concerns about the NMEU approach to measuring consumer preferences in\\nthe presence of uncertainty and risk, it is widely used in economic analysis. With multipletime periods most analysts make the expected utility function time-separable with a constantsubjective discount factor ( δ), where, for an infinitely lived agent, we have:\\n(3.13)\\nwith 0 < δ≤  1 being a measure of impatience for future consumption expenditure which is\\ndetermined by the rate of time preference ( ρ), with δ=1/(1 +ρ).\\nAs noted earlier, consumers who can trade in every state of nature will, in the absence of\\ntrading costs or other market frictions, have the same expected growth rate in their marginalutilities and, as a consequence, face the same consumption risk. For that reason they meas-ure risk in securities by their contribution to aggregate consumption risk.

In project evaluation analysts include a riskpremium in discount factors on risky net cash flows, and the task is less complex when con-sumers measure and price risk in the same way. In effect, risk aversion measures the degreeof concavity in the utility function over uncertain consumption expenditure. An example isshown in Figure 3.5 where income can vary between I\\n1and I2with probabilities π1and π2,\\nrespectively. To simplify the analysis we assume there is one future time period. With state-independent preferences we can map utility from consumption in each state using thefunction U(I\\n~), where the loss in utility from facing the variance in income is U(I¯) −EU(II~)\\nfor I¯=E(I~). In monetary terms the consumer is prepared to forgo income RP(I¯)=I¯−Îto\\nreceive Îwith certainty. Clearly, this difference rises with the degree of concavity of the \\nutility function.\\nArrow (1971) and Pratt (1964) define a number of widely used measures of risk aversion.\\nThe first of them is:\\nFor a strictly concave utility function, such as the one illustrated in Figure 3.5, a negative\\nsecond derivative makes ARA positive. One way of isolating this measure of risk aversionis to take a second-order Taylor series expansion around I¯for the relationship that defines\\nthe risk premium ( RP) in Figure 3.5, where EU(I~) =U[I¯−RP(I¯)], as\\nRP IUI\\nUIARAII ()()\\n(). =−′′\\n′=1\\n21222 3 1 σσ88 Uncertainty and risk\\nIsI2 I1U\\nRP(–I) = –I − ^I\\n–I ^IU(–I)\\nEU(I)U(I)\\n~\\nFigure 3.5 Consumption with expected utility and objective probabilities.Definition 3.6 The coefficient of absolute risk aversion (ARA) measures the curvature of the util-\\nity function as\\n(3.14)ARAUI\\nUI:()\\n()=−′′\\n′', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 100}),\n",

DARA has some intuitive appeal because consumers with relatively high incomes(and wealth) are less averse to risk at the margin. When ARA declines as income rises theutility function becomes less concave because U′′falls more than does U′.\\nPerhaps the most widely used measure of risk aversion is the following:\\nIt is obtained as the coefficient on the variance in the proportional, rather than absolute,\\nchange in consumption expenditure.\\n32Anecdotal evidence suggests consumers with higher\\nincome (and wealth) have a lower ARA. But this may well be consistent with all consumershaving the same RRA. Indeed, there are empirical studies that find support for preferenceswith a constant coefficient of relative risk aversion (CRRA). Alternatively they could have\\ndecreasing relative risk aversion (DRRA) or increasing relative risk aversion (IRRA), as\\nnone are ruled out by the conventional restrictions imposed on preferences in consumertheory. It is ultimately an empirical question what values ARA and RRA take for consumers,and whether they rise or fall with wealth.\\nThere is more empirical support for DARA than there is for DRRA. Barsky et al. (1997)\\nused survey data to find that RRA rises and then falls with wealth, while Guiso and Paiella (2001) used survey data to find that DARA and IRRA. Experimental studies byGordon et al . (1972), Binswanger (1981) and Quizon et al . (1984) found \\nsupport for IRRA because the fraction of wealth consumers invest in risky securitiesdeclines with their wealth, contrary to US household data where the fraction of wealth consumers invest in risky securities increases as their wealth increases. Peress (2004)includes costly information to explain these conflicting observations, where increasingreturns to information acquisition are large enough to overturn the tendency for consumerportfolio shares to decrease with wealth. Estimates of the value of the coefficient of RRA range from near 0 to 2. For example, Friend and Blume (1975) obtain an estimate from US household data around 2, and Fullenkamp et al. (2003) use data from a television\\ngame show with large amounts of money at stake and find a value in the range from 0.6 to 1.5.\\n3.2.3 Mean –variance preferences\\nMost consumption-based pricing models are derived using mean–variance analysis where\\npreferences for future consumption can be completely described by the first two moments ofthe probability distribution over state-contingent outcomes.

By exploiting any prof-its they invoke the no arbitrage condition on security returns. This activity highlights theimportant role of information, where traders compute the statistical properties of the net rev-enues generated by underlying real assets from which security returns are paid. The incomepaid to shareholders ultimately comes from production activities by the firms who issueshares, and investors gather information about these activities as well as any other condi-tions that will affect the economic income they generate. Traders who can acquire andprocess information more efficiently can make profits by finding assets with the same riskpaying different expected returns. This arbitrage activity, if unrestricted, will feed privateinformation into current security prices until assets with the same risk pay the sameexpected returns in a competitive equilibrium. Unless traders have more information thandoes the market (which is the public information reflected in current security prices) theycannot expect to make profits from trading securities. In particular, no trading rule can out-perform a buy and hold strategy when the no arbitrage condition holds.\\nLoosely speaking, this is referred to as the efficient markets hypothesis . Fama (1970)\\nargued the capital market is efficient when the information of traders is included in securityprices, and identified three different versions of efficiency based on three different informa-tion sets: a weak form of efficiency when information is based on past prices; a semi-strongform of efficiency when the information is past prices plus publicly available information;and a strong form of efficiency when the information also includes insider information.There is considerable interest in finding an economic model of asset pricing that is consis-tent with the efficient markets hypothesis.\\n34Samuelson (1965) did this using a martingale\\nmodel , where random variable xtis a martingale with respect to an information set ωtif it\\nhas E(xt+1|ωt) =xt, with E(•) being the expectations operator. By a process of iteration the\\nexpected future values of the variable are the same as its current value. Samuelson arguedsecurity prices will be a discounted martingale if consumers are risk-neutral. Basically, theprices of securities paying only capital gains must rise at the risk-free interest rate when theno arbitrage condition holds for risk-neural consumers. And that makes discounted futureprices equal to current prices.\\n35\\nThe martingale model can be demonstrated by writing the state-contingent discounts \\nfactors in (3.11) as ϕs=1/(1 +is) for all s. When consumers are risk-neutral these discount\\nfactors become ϕs=πs/(1 +i) for all s,where 1/(1 +i) is the price of a risk-free bond, with\\nΣsϕs=1/(1 +i).

Without making further assumptions, however, the task of estimating thestochastic discount factors in (3.17) is potentially complex. In each time period the variancein aggregate consumption expenditure depends on the variance in income as well as the vari-ance in relative commodity prices in all future time periods. Thus, even with time-separableexpected utility, consumption in each period is a function of wealth, which is the discountedpresent value of all future consumption flows. And relative commodity prices matterbecause they determine the real consumption opportunities in each future time period. In ageneral equilibrium setting, aggregate consumption is likely to be a non-linear function thatis potentially cumbersome to use in computational work. But even if we manage to solve itas a function of one or a small number of aggregate variables, we also need to measure thestochastic properties of the randomness they impart to aggregate consumption. Popular pric-ing models in finance adopt mean–variance analysis, where these two moments completelysummarize the impact of risk in aggregate consumption on the utility of consumers. Thereare two ways to invoke a mean–variance analysis on the CBPM in (3.17).\\ni Consumers with quadratic preferences care only about the mean and variance in their\\n(real) consumption expenditure.\\n49An example is the utility function U(I~) =aI~−1⁄2bI~2\\nwhich makes the stochastic discount factor\\n,\\nwhere the pricing equation for any security kin (3.19), using and\\n, becomes\\n(3.31)\\nwith ψ=− (1 +i) [δb/(a−bI0)] being a constant coefficient.

The derivative security is a mimick-\\ning portfolio constructed to replicate the risk in aggregate consumption (with βII=1)\\nwhere the pricing equation in (3.32) differs from (3.19) by measuring risk in securityreturns by their covariance with aggregate consumption rather than the discountedchange in marginal utility. In effect, quadratic preferences make changes in aggregateconsumption a proxy for changes in marginal utility. And the model also holds uncondi-tionally in a multi-period setting (which means it is independent of the time period)when the risk-free return is constant and security returns are identical and independentlyand identically distributed to rule out shifts in the investment opportunity set over time.λII Iii=−() / σ2βσIk Ik I ii =Cov( , )//tildenosp/tildenosp 2iikI k I−= βλ ,50Cov( , )/tildenosp/tildenospIiII=σ2ii I ikk−= ψ Cov( , ),/tildenosp/tildenospEmi() / ( )/tildenosp=+11/tildenosp/tildenosp Ri pkk a k()1+/tildenosp/tildenosp\\nmab I\\nab I=−\\n−⎛\\n⎝⎜⎞\\n⎠⎟δ\\n0', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 113}),\n",

It can be a derivative security created by bundling traded securities togetherin a portfolio. There is a 68.26 per cent probability that the asset return will lie within onestandard deviation of the mean ( −2 and 22 percentage points), a 95.44 per cent probabil-\\nity it will lie within two standard deviations of the mean ( −14 and 34 percentage points),\\nand a 99.74 per cent probability it will lie within three standard deviations of the mean (−26 and 46 percentage points).

       " Document(page_content='4 Asset pricing models\\nWhen traders value capital assets they include a risk premium in their discount factors as\\ncompensation for any market risk in the net cash flows. This adjustment is made for projects undertaken by the public and private sectors, and for securities they sell to financethem. In a competitive capital market where the no arbitrage condition holds, traders facethe same risk premium, but they may not compute it in the same way. Indeed, consumerswith different information can measure and price risk differently, where asset pricing modelsare agent–specific. A key objective in finance research is to derive an asset pricing modelwhere consumers measure and price risk in the same way. Ideally it should also be straightforward to use by isolating risk with a small number of state variables that arereported as aggregate data in national accounts. In this chapter we examine four equilibriumasset pricing models that do this – the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) developed by\\nSharpe (1964) and Lintner (1965), the intertemporal capital asset pricing model (ICAPM)\\nby Merton (1973a), the arbitrage pricing theory (APT) by Ross (1976) and the consump-\\ntion-beta capital asset pricing model (CCAPM) by Breeden and Litzenberger (1978) and\\nBreeden (1979).\\nFollowing Cochrane (2001) we derive these models as special cases of the consumption-\\nbased pricing model (CBPM) obtained earlier in (3.17). It can be summarized as E\\nt(m~R~\\nk)=pak, where Et(.) is the common expectations operator conditioned on information\\navailable at time the stochastic discount factor, with for each period \\nthe stochastic payouts to security k, and pakits price at time t. Since consumers ulti-\\nmately derive utility from bundles of goods, they value securities by their contribution tofinal consumption, and with common and p\\nakthey have the same stochastic \\ndiscount factor ( m~) when they can trade in a frictionless competitive capital market. As the\\ndiscount factors are determined by consumption in each period, consumers therefore havethe same consumption risk in the CBPM. Thus, we can solve them as functions of variablesthat determine aggregate consumption risk. Unfortunately, however, they are in generalquite complex non-linear functions that are difficult to solve and estimate empirically.\\nThe four pricing models overcome this problem by placing restrictions on preferences,\\nwealth and/or the stochastic properties of security returns and aggregate consumption. Theyall have a linear stochastic discount factor in the state variables (factors) used to isolateaggregate consumption risk. The return on the risky (market) portfolio is the only factor inthe CAPM because consumer wealth is confined to portfolios of securities. And expectedsecurity returns are linearly related to their covariance with this factor because they are jointly normally distributed. The ICAPM extends the CAPM to allow consumption riskto change over time due to shifts in the investment opportunity set and changes in relative com-modity prices. Additional state variables are used to account for these changes in aggregateERtk() ,⋅⋅/tildenospτ,/tildenospRk/tildenosp/tildenosp mU I It ττδ= ′() / () tm,/tildenosp', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 119}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='consumption risk, thereby increasing the covariance terms in the linear pricing equation. In the\\nCCAPM consumers have the same constant coefficient of relative risk aversion (CRRA) whensecurity returns are lognormally distributed with aggregate consumption. This provides a one-to-one mapping between changes in wealth and consumption in each time period whereexpected security returns are linear in their covariance with aggregate consumption. The APTadopts a different approach by using a linear factor analysis to isolate risk in security returns.The factors themselves are not necessarily the source of consumption risk, but rather they aremacro-variables used to identify any common component of changes in security returns – thatis, to identify their systematic risk. There is no requirement for the returns to be jointly normallydistributed in the APT as the linearity is imposed through the factor analysis.\\nAll of these models have strengths and weaknesses. For example, the single factors in the\\nCAPM and the CCAPM are identified by the models themselves, while the additional factorsin the ICAPM and the factors in the APT are not specified by the models. Unfortunately con-sumers have no risky income from labour or other capital assets in the CAPM and the ICAPM,as income is confined to payouts on portfolios of securities. Wages and salaries are a signifi-cant source of income for most consumers and it can also be stochastic, particularly in sectorsof the economy that experience regular fluctuations in activity. While labour and other incomeare included in the CCAPM, consumers must have the same constant coefficient of relativerisk aversion for the variance in aggregate consumption to be the single risk factor. There arealso problems measuring aggregate consumption flows as figures reported in the nationalaccounts omit leisure and other non-marketed goods, and they include some items that shouldreally be included in capital expenditure. In practice, the CAPM is widely used because of itssimplicity and accessibility to data. Most use a broadly based index of stocks trading on thenational stock exchange as their market portfolio. They are a value-weighted index, like theStandard Poor’ s 500 in the United States and the All Ordinaries Index in Australia.\\nInitially the CAPM was derived as the solution to the portfolio choice problem of consumers.\\nMost textbook presentations follow this approach by deriving the efficient mean–variance fron-tier for risky securities in a frictionless competitive capital market to demonstrate the diversifi-\\ncation effect . When security returns are less than perfectly correlated some of their variability\\ncan be eliminated by holding them in portfolios. Any risk that cannot be diversified in this wayis market (non-diversifiable) risk that someone in the economy must bear. Thus, it is the onlyrisk that attracts a premium in security returns. The CAPM is examined in Section 4.1 belowby following the approach used in Copeland and Weston (1988) where the efficient mean–vari-\\nance frontier for risky securities is derived in a number of steps.\\n1The analysis begins with two\\nrisky securities to demonstrate the diversification effect identified by Markowitz (1959) andTobin (1958). Consumers are then allowed to hold portfolios that combine a risky security witha risk-free security along a linear budget constraint called the capital market line . The APT is\\nalso examined separately in Section 4.2 to demonstrate the role of arbitrage in removing diver-sifiable risk from consumption expenditure, and the role of mimicking portfolios to pricemarket (non-diversifiable) risk. These are common features of the consumption-based modelsexamined in this chapter. Another reason for analysing the APT separately is to demonstrate alinear factor analysis which isolates market risk empirically by identifying the common com-ponent in security returns. We then follow Cochrane (2001) and derive the four consumption-based pricing models – the CAPM, the ICAPM, the APT and the CCAPM – as special cases ofthe CBPM in Section 4.3. These derivations are slightly more formal because they focus on thedirect link between consumption and security returns, with portfolio choices and arbitragepushed into the background of the analysis. For that reason we start the analysis by deriving theCAPM as the solution to the portfolio choices of consumers in Section 4.1, and the APT modelas the solution to arbitrage portfolios in Section 4.2.108 Asset pricing models', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 120}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='As noted above, the most attractive feature of the CBPM is that every consumer measures\\nand prices risk in the same way, where in equilibrium the return on each asset ( k) is equal to\\nthe risk-free interest rate ( i) plus a risk premium ( Θk) for the market risk in the asset, with \\nik=i +Θk. Conveniently, investors compute this risk premium by measuring the same quan-\\ntity of market risk ( qRk), which they value at the same price ( pR), with Θk=pRqRK. The task is\\nfurther simplified by the fact that market risk is the non-diversifiable variance in an asset’ sreturn. In more general models, however, the equilibrium risk premium will not be measuredand priced identically by consumers, where more information than just the variance in theasset return may be required to isolate market risk. For example, with trading costs consumerscan have different consumption risk, where the pricing models become agent-specific.\\nTo see how the pricing models are used in practice, consider an asset ( k) with random net\\ncash flows of \\nR˜kin the second period. Using one of the four consumption-based pricing\\nmodels, we can compute its current price as\\nwhere R¯kis the expected payout to the security. The discount rate i+Θkcompensates asset\\nholders for the opportunity cost of time ( i) and the market (non-diversifiable) risk in the net\\ncash flows ( Θk) on each dollar of capital invested in the asset. Even though the risk premium\\nis isolated using different state variables in the four models it is computed in the same waybecause every consumer has the same consumption risk.\\n4.1 Capital asset pricing model\\nAs noted earlier, the CAPM is a popular pricing model because it is relatively straightforward to use. But it relies on a number of important assumptions that may not holdin practice. For that reason it is important to know the role they play so that users can assessthe integrity of CAPM estimates. Financial analysts frequently use the model to approxi-mate the risk premium on capital assets in a systematic way, rather than making a roughguess. Then, by choosing a range of values around this estimate, they undertake a sensitivity analysis to see what difference other assumptions make in the evaluation process.In this section we derive the CAPM by analysing the portfolio choices of consumers. Theanalysis commences with a summary of consumer preferences and the consumption space,before deriving the investment opportunity set. Then the pricing equation is obtained bybringing these two components together in the optimization problem for consumers. Finally,we relax the assumptions in the CAPM to see what role they play.\\n4.1.1 Consumption space and preferences\\nAll the consumption risk in the CAPM originates from the risk in the returns to portfolios\\nof securities held by consumers. We capture this by writing the consumer problem in thetwo-period Arrow–Debreu asset economy as\\n,\\n2(4.1)\\nwhere Rs=ΣkakRksis the payout to the portfolio of securities in each state s.3Consumers\\nhave no labour income in the second period, and no income from capital assets such asmax vIXX V I\\nXR IsSS S(),00 0 00≤− + ≡\\n≤≡ ∀⎧\\n⎨⎪\\n⎩⎪⎫\\n⎬⎪\\n⎭⎪ηPR\\niakk\\nk=++1 Θ,Asset pricing models 109', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 121}),\n",

Indeed, it may take\\nadditional moments for the distribution to fully describe the returns on portfolios, and risk maynot be linearly related to them. One way to rescue the CAPM is to adopt quadratic preferences,where investors only care about the means and variances in their portfolio returns. But placing restrictions on preferences is much less appealing. A number of empirical studies havetested security returns on portfolios to see whether they are jointly normality distributed. Fama(1965) did so for securities traded on the New Y ork Stock Exchange and found they were symmetric with fat tails. In other words, they are approximately bell-shaped with infinite variances.\\nIf investors have heterogeneous expectations they will not observe the same mean–\\nvariance frontier for risky securities.

Asymmetric information is much\\nmore likely when information is costly to acquire, where investors with different costs willlikely have different information and form different expectations about security returns.Most popular asset pricing models assume there are no transactions costs, based largely onthe view that institutional investors, who are specialist traders in the capital market, have lowmarginal transactions costs. In these circumstances they create risky mutual funds for individual consumers facing higher costs due to the relatively small value of their securitytrades.\\nA number of interesting puzzles arise in finance when equilibrium outcomes are exam-\\nined in models without trading costs. For example, firms pay no dividends to fully taxableshareholders in economies with a classical corporate tax system. This so-called dividend\\npuzzle is examined later in Chapter 7 where one of the explanations relies on differential\\ntrading costs on paying dividends and capital gains.\\nThe CAPM holds when there are more than two time periods if the interest rate and rela-\\ntive commodity prices are constant and security returns are independently and identicallydistributed over time. This leaves consumers facing the same efficient mean–variance fron-tier, and the same real income, in every time period. Once consumption risk changes overtime the CAPM fails to hold. Merton (1973a) extends the CAPM to the intertemporal set-ting by adding additional factors in the pricing equation to explain changes in market risk.This is the intertemporal CAPM which we examine later in Section 4.3.2.\\n4.2 Arbitrage pricing theory\\nOne of the less attractive features of the CAPM is that it predicts every consumer will holdthe same risky portfolio. It also relies on security returns being jointly normally distributedand consumers holding all their net wealth in financial securities. In response to these con-cerns Ross (1976) derives a pricing equation by isolating the common component ofchanges in security returns using a linear factor analysis.\\nAs the name suggests, the APT relies crucially on arbitrage to eliminate any profits from\\nsecurity returns and to provide investors with the ability to eliminate idiosyncratic risk fromtheir portfolios. An important starting point is the assumption that security returns can befully described by a linear factor model, where the random return on any traded security k\\nis related to g =1, ... , Gfactors and noise, with:\\n(4.22)\\nwhere β\\nkgis the sensitivity of the return on security kto the risk isolated by factor g, f~\\ngthe\\ndeviation in the value of factor gfrom its mean value (with f~\\ng=F~\\ng−_\\nFgand\\nand an error term (with .

       " Document(page_content='While there are two time periods in the CAPM derived by Sharpe and Lintner, it also\\nholds for multiple time periods when the interest rate and relative commodity prices are con-stant and security returns are i.i.d. over time. In effect, consumers are in a steady-state equi-librium facing the same aggregate risk in each period, where the market risk in securityreturns in every period is described by a single factor, which is how they covary with thereturn on the market portfolio. Based on this derivation, we find two important features ofthe CAPM model. First, all the aggregate consumption risk comes through security returns,thereby limiting the ability of the CAPM to explain how consumers measure risk when theyalso have income from labour and other capital assets. Second, changes in aggregate consumption risk are not accommodated by the CAPM. The ICAPM addresses this problemby extending the CAPM to multiple time periods by including additional factors to describechanges in the investment opportunity set and relative commodity prices.\\n4.3.2 Intertemporal capital asset pricing model\\nAs noted above, the popularity of the CAPM stems from its simplicity – in particular, the\\nway it isolates consumption risk with a single state variable using mean–variance analysis.And this state variable is specified by the model as the variance in the return on the marketportfolio which every consumer combines with a risk-free bond. In applied work the marketportfolio is normally derived as a value-weighted index of the securities trading on the stockexchange. While the CAPM is frequently used by analysts in a multi-period setting, there isevidence to suggest aggregate consumption risk changes over time. Merton (1973a) extendsthe CAPM to accommodate changes in the investment opportunity set using a continuous-time analysis. The model maintains most of the assumptions in the CAPM – in particular,that consumers with homogeneous expectations maximize state-independent time-separableexpected utility functions, they hold all their wealth in portfolios of securities, and can tradea risk-free bond (but with a return that can vary over time).\\n20We derive the ICAPM as a spe-\\ncial case of the CBPM in (4.28) using a discrete-time analysis of the consumer problemsummarized by the value function in (4.31) where vectors of additional state variable ( z) are\\nincluded to describe changes in aggregate consumption risk. To obtain the model in Mertonwe make the following additional assumptions:\\ni At the beginning of each period tconsumer wealth is confined to a portfolio of finan-\\ncial securities a\\nw\\ntwith market value and a stochastic net return over the \\nnext period of .21\\nii Security returns are jointly-normally distributed.\\nRelaxing assumptions (iii) and (iv) in the CAPM allows aggregate consumption risk to\\nchange over time. Following Merton, we restrict the analysis to a single consumption goodand assume changes in aggregate risk can be described by a single state variable. When secu-rity returns and the state variable are multi-variate normal we use Stein’ s lemma (see note 19)to decompose the pricing equation in (4.28), with the stochastic discount factor in (4.32), as:\\n(4.34)\\nwhere \\nAi EVp a\\nVBiWW aW\\nW=− +⎧\\n⎨\\n⎩⎫\\n⎬\\n⎭=− + ()()\\n()( 11 δ⋅⋅\\n⋅⋅and ))()\\n(). δEV\\nVWz\\nW⋅⋅\\n⋅⋅⎧\\n⎨\\n⎩⎫\\n⎬\\n⎭iiA i i B z ikM k k−= + Cov Cov(, ) ( , ) ,/tildenosp/tildenosp/tildenosp/tildenosp\\n122/tildenospiWt,+1pa W Iat tW\\ntt=−136 Asset pricing models', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 148}),\n",

None are specified in the APT because thefactors are macro variables chosen to provide the best fit in a linear factor analysis (with thehighest R\\n2). In the ICAPM the variance in the market portfolio isolates consumption risk,\\nbut none of the factors used to explain changes in market risk over time are specified by themodel. Thus, both models are more difficult to use than the CAPM.

       " Document(page_content='consumers with homogeneous expectations have the same stochastic discount factor and, as\\na consequence, the same changes in marginal utility. Given the inverse relationship betweenmarginal utility and consumption, they must also have the same consumption risk. Thus, the stochastic discount factor in the CBPM can be solved as a function of aggregate consumption risk.\\nAny differences in the models arise from the additional assumptions they make to isolate\\nthe aggregate consumption risk. All of them use mean–variance analysis, where it resultsfrom consumption risk being normally distributed in the CAPM, ICAPM and CCAPM, whileit results from a linear factor analysis in the APT.\\n34For the CAPM and the ICAPM future con-\\nsumption is funded solely from payoffs to securities. And since consumers can trade a risk-free security they combine it with the same bundle of risky securities ( M) whose vari-\\nance determines changes in their future consumption expenditure. In the two-period CAPMthere is a single beta coefficient that measures how much security returns covary with thereturn on M, while there are additional beta coefficients in the multi-period ICAPM that sum-\\nmarize changes in the investment opportunity set (and relative commodity prices). The multi-period CCAPM also has a single beta coefficient because consumers have the same constantcoefficient of relative risk aversion that makes consumption expenditure a constant coefficientfraction of wealth in each time period. The APT model is also a multi-period model which,like the ICAPM, uses a number of factors to isolate changes in aggregate consumption risk.\\nOn the plus side, the single factors in the CAPM and CCAPM are specified by each\\nmodel, while the multiple factors in the ICAPM and the APT are variables that investors frequently monitor when assessing the returns to securities. Also, ICAPM, CCAPM andAPT can be used in a multi-period setting. On the minus side, the CAPM cannot be used ina multi-period setting unless security returns are i.i.d. and the interest rate and relative com-modity prices are constant over time. But consumers need to have the same constant coef-ficient of relative risk aversion in the CCAPM, while the additional factors used to isolatechanges in consumption risk are not specified in the ICAPM or the APT.\\nA criticism that is common to all models is that they are based on the CBPM in (4.28) where\\nconsumers have time-separable NMEU functions. Arguably, the most restrictive assumption isthat of homogeneous expectations. If we allow consumers to have different subjective expectations they will, in general, measure and price risk differently, where pricing models are based on individual, rather than aggregate data. Another extension would allow state-dependent preferences, but again consumers would likely measure and price risk differently,even with homogeneous expectations, as they would no longer have the same changes in consumption expenditure over time. Thus, we cannot solve the discount factors in (4.28) asfunctions of aggregate consumption expenditure. Indeed, the problem is further compoundedwhen consumers have both state-dependent preferences and subjective expectations.\\n4.5 Empirical tests of the consumption-based pricing models\\nGiven the nature of the assumptions made in the consumption-based pricing model in (4.28), it should not be surprising that the asset pricing models derived from it performpoorly when confronted with data. There are good practical reasons for wanting to derivepricing models where consumers measure and price risk identically using a small number of state variables that can be accessed in reported data. Models based on individual consumption data are impractical because it is costly data to obtain.\\nOne problem for empirical tests of these pricing models is the absence of appropriate data\\n– in particular, the expected values of the risk factors and the means and variances on Asset pricing models 143', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 155}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='security returns. Most studies assume that ex-post time series data provides a true reflection\\nof the statistical attributes of their distributions when observed by consumers ex ante.Another problem arises when the reported data does not provide all the information needed.For example, consumers in the CCAPM measure market risk in security returns by theircovariance with aggregate real consumption expenditure. It must include consumption flowsto capital, as well as non-marketed consumption such as leisure and other home-producedgoods. Most countries measure their national accounts on a quarterly basis where aggregateconsumption expenditure excludes expenditure on major capital items and includes therental value of housing consumed by owner-occupiers. However, some capital expenditureis included, while a considerable proportion of non-marketed consumption is omitted. Thesediscrepancies may not be a significant problem if they are closely correlated with measuredaggregate real consumption, particularly when on average they are relatively small.\\n35\\nEarly empirical studies tested the pricing models, in particular the CAPM, to see whether\\nthey could successfully explain the risk premiums in security returns without consideringwhether the resulting consumption risk was consistent with measures of risk aversionobtained from observed consumer behaviour. That link was made later by Mehra andPrescott (1985) who tested the CCAPM using a computable general equilibrium modelwhere they identified equity premium and low risk-free real interest rate puzzles. We sum-marize these empirical findings in the following two subsections.\\n4.5.1 Empirical tests and the Roll critique\\nUsing time series data Black et al. (1972) divide all the securities traded on the New Y ork\\nStock Exchange (NYSE) over the period 1931–1965 into 10 portfolios and estimate thecoefficients on the CAPM pricing equation:\\nwhere λ\\n0=0 and when the CAPM holds.

They con-\\nstruct 12 portfolios with approximately 80 different stocks listed on the NYSE over threeseparate periods between 1955 and 1968. Fama and MacBeth (1973) extend the analysis inBlack et al. and find omitted variables in the CAPM. Their findings support the multi-factor\\nICAPM that accounts for changes in aggregate consumption risk.\\nRoll (1977a) was critical of these (and other) empirical tests of the CAPM, arguing that\\nthe only true test is whether the market portfolio is ex ante mean–variance efficient, wherethe linearity of the model follows by implication. There are an infinite number ofmean–variance efficient market portfolios where by construction the expected returns on theindividual securities in each portfolio must be linearly related to their beta coefficients.\\nFama and French (1992, 1993) include firm size and book-to-market equity ratios as\\nadditional factors to explain a cross-section of average returns to securities traded on theNYSE not explained by the CAPM or the CCAPM.

But instead of including additional factors to describe changes in consumptionrisk they scale the parameters in the discount factor with a proxy for the logconsumption–wealth ratio, and find the conditional models perform about as well as thethree-factor pricing model used by Fama and French.\\n36Their findings are supported by\\nCampbell and Cochrane (2000) who test the conditional versions of the CAPM andCCAPM. Using US data, Hansen and Singleton (1982, 1983) find the unconditionalCCAPM performs poorly in explaining the time variation in interest rates and the cross-sectional pattern of average returns on stocks and bonds, while Wheatley (1988) also rejectsthe model using international data. In fact, Mankiw and Shapiro (1986), Breeden et al.\\n(1989), Campbell (1996) and Cochrane (1996) find it performs no better than, and in mostcases worse than, the unconditional CAPM in explaining cross-sectional differences in aver-age returns. Campbell and Cochrane (2000) argue the market return in the CAPM capturestime variations in risk premiums much better than consumption growth in the CCAPMbecause the market return is affected by dividend–price ratios while consumption growth isnot. This view is supported by Campbell (1993) based on empirical tests of a discrete-timeversion of the ICAPM.\\n4.5.2 Asset pricing puzzles\\nAs noted by Cochrane (2001), early tests of the CAPM and ICAPM focused on their ability\\nto explain the risk premiums in expected security returns without considering how muchrisk was being transferred into real consumption expenditure. When testing the CCAPM,Mehra and Prescott looked at whether the implied values of the (constant) coefficient of rel-ative risk aversion and the (constant) rate of time preference were consistent with the risk inaggregate real consumption. Using US data, they discovered the equity premium and lowrisk-free real interest rate puzzles, where the premium puzzle finds the need to adopt a coef-ficient of relative risk aversion in the CCAPM that is approximately five times larger thanits estimated value in experimental work, while the low risk-free rate puzzle finds theobserved real interest rate much lower than the CCAPM would predict when the coefficientof relative risk aversion is set at its estimated value. Once it is set at the higher valuesrequired to explain the observed equity premium the predicted real interest rate is evenhigher.\\nWe demonstrate these puzzles using the Hansen and Jagannathan (1991) bound on the price\\nof risk in security returns. It is an adaptation of the Sharpe ratio (Sharp 1966) which measures\\nthe equilibrium price of risk, for any security k, as Using the CBPM equation in\\n(4.28) when consumers have a power utility function and security returns are jointly log normally distributed with aggregate consumption, we have the following definition.\\n() / .iikk−σAsset pricing models 145\\nDefinition 4.1 TheHansen-Jagannathan bound on the equilibrium price of risk in the CCAPM is\\n(4.42)\\nwhere smis the variance in the pricing kernel, γthe constant coefficient of risk aversion and sg\\nthe growth rate in aggregate real consumption expenditure, with . /tildenosp/tildenosp/tildenosp/tildenosp II g g I I I/( ) /00 0 1=+ = − andiiiik\\nkmg−≤+ ≈+σσγ σ () () ,11', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 157}),\n",

Most extensions relax time separability and state independencein the following ways.\\nHabit theory . This makes utility for a representative agent depend on one or a combina-\\ntion of past own consumption ( internal habit ), past consumption of others, and the current\\nconsumption of others ( external habit ). These models add a habit variable to the utility \\nfunction at each point in time, where its equilibrium effects are determined by the way habitsare formed and how they change over time. For example, Abel (1990) models habit as a multiplicative function of past consumption by others, together with past own consumptionln( ln .38 1+≈ −iE g)( )γδ/tildenospAsset pricing models 147\\nTable 4.5 Low risk-free interest rate puzzle\\nRRA( γ) Mehra and Prescott data Cochrane data\\nFord=0.99\\n1 2.88% 2.03%2 4.78% 3.05%\\n10 21.29% 11.63%50 152.20% 66.54%For δ=0.94\\n1 8.35% 7.45%2 10.35% 8.53%\\n10 27.75% 17.57%\\n50 165.61% 75.40%Eg() %/tildenosp=1 Eg() . %/tildenosp=18 3', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 159}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='to capture internal habit, Constantinides (1990) makes habit an exponential function of past\\nown consumption, and Campbell and Cochrane (1999) make it an additive function of pastconsumption by all other consumers.\\n41\\nWith internal habit consumers become attached to a particular level of consumption\\nwhich they prefer to maintain, while external habit is based on past consumption of others,reflecting a concern for relative consumption levels. The benefits most people get from con-sumption at any point in time depend on their past consumption as well as the amount con-sumed by neighbours or their social peers. Internal habit extends standard preferences byrelaxing time separability, while external habit introduces consumption externalities. Bothapproaches provide an explanation for the risk-free rate puzzle by raising aggregate saving.For internal habit consumers save more when consumption is habit-forming, while for exter-nal habit they save more due to their sensitivity to aggregate consumption risk.\\n42Both\\napproaches explain a large equity premium if, in the case of internal habit, consumers arehighly sensitive to their own consumption risk, or, in the case of external habit, they arehighly sensitive to aggregate consumption risk. But high sensitivity to own consumption riskrequires a high degree of risk aversion, whereas aggregate consumption is fairly smooth.Thus, in both cases a high degree of risk aversion is required to explain why consumers areindifferent between bonds and equity. In other words, habit formation cannot successfullyexplain the equity premium puzzle identified by Mehra and Prescott.\\n43\\nSeparating risk aversion from intertemporal substitution . There is an inverse relationship\\nbetween the CRRA and the elasticity of intertemporal substitution when consumers havestandard preferences. Indeed, for the power utility function the elastic-ity of intertemporal substitution is 1/ γ.\\n44Thus, highly risk-averse consumers view consump-\\ntion in different time periods as more complementary. And when they are reluctant tosubstitute consumption intertemporally in a growing economy the equilibrium interest ratehas to be higher. Epstein and Zin (1989) suggest using the generalized expected utility pref-erences of Kreps and Porteous (1978) and Selden (1978) that separate the coefficient of rel-ative risk aversion from the elasticity of intertemporal substitution. They write the utilityfunction as\\nwhere θ= (1 − γ)/(1 − 1/Ω) with Ωbeing the elasticity of intertemporal substitution. This\\ncollapses to the time-separable power utility function when γ=1/Ω. While relaxing this\\ninverse relationship provides a solution to the risk-free rate puzzle, it does not solve theequity premium puzzle. Ultimately, a relatively high value for the CRRA is required toexplain the large equity premium in the presence of low consumption risk.\\nBehavioural experiments and loss aversion . Benartzi and Thaler (1995) and Barberis \\net al. (2001) use evidence from behavioural studies to justify the inclusion of a state vari-\\nable in the utility function to capture additional welfare effects from financial gains andlosses on security portfolios. They argue that utility falls more when there are losses than itrises when there are gains, where these welfare effects are not captured as direct benefitsderived from their consumption flows. In effect, they suffer from loss aversion which drivesup the risk premium on equity. Thus, the equity premium in the data can be explained witha lower CRRA. While this approach can successfully explain the equity premium and risk-free rate puzzles, it does so in a somewhat ad hoc fashion. In fact, it may provide evidencethat consumer preferences are state-dependent.UIEU I EItt t t t t,( ) ( ) ( )/\\n+−\\n+−( )=− + ( ) 11\\n1111δδγθ γ///( )\\n,θθγ⎡\\n⎣⎢⎤\\n⎦⎥−1UI Itt() / ( )=−−11γγ148 Asset pricing models', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 160}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Heterogeneous consumption risk\\nConsumers have the same individual consumption risk in the consumption-based pricing\\nmodels because they can costlessly eliminate diversifiable risk. A number of studies extendthese models by allowing individuals to face different consumption risk. This personalizesthe asset pricing equation and impacts on the equilibrium risk premium. There are a numberof reasons for incomplete insurance, including (i) incomplete markets and borrowing con-straints and (ii) transactions costs.\\nIncomplete markets and borrowing constraints can stop consumers from eliminating\\ndiversifiable risk from their consumption expenditure. In particular, they may not be ableinsure against variations in labour income when human capital cannot be used as collateral,and private insurance may be restricted by moral hazard and adverse selection problems inthe presence of asymmetric information. Weil (1992) is able to explain the equity premiumand risk-free rate puzzles in a two-period setting with incomplete financial markets.Consumers who cannot fully insure against idiosyncratic risk will save more to offsetincreases in future consumption risk. The extra saving drives down the risk-free rate, whilethe extra individual consumption risk drives up the equilibrium premium on returns toequity over debt. However, the ability of incomplete markets to explain these pricing puzzles is mitigated in an multi-period setting by dynamic self-insurance where consumerscan offset low (transitory) consumption shocks by borrowing. This provides them with asubstitute for insurance unless there are borrowing constraints. Heaton and Lucas (1996)make numerical simulations in a computable general equilibrium model where they findthat incomplete markets and borrowing constraints have a small effect on the risk-free interest rate in an infinite horizon setting.\\n45\\nConstantinides and Duffie (1996) extend the analysis of incomplete financial markets by\\nmaking idiosyncratic labour income shocks permanent. For example, when labour incomefalls and stays low for ever, dynamic self-insurance cannot overcome the inevitable fall inconsumption, even in the absence of borrowing constraints. When these income shocks aresufficiently large and persist they can raise individual consumption risk above aggregateconsumption risk sufficiently to explain the low interest rate and high equity premiums inthe data. However, Heaton and Lucas estimate idiosyncratic shocks to labour income usingUS data and find it has an autocorrelation of approximately 0.5 that reduces the risk-freerate by only a small amount.\\nTransactions costs explain the equity premium when equity is much more costly to trade\\nthan debt. Based on turnover rates for equity traded on the NYSE, Fisher (1994) finds thatthe bid–ask spread on equity needs to be as high as 9.4 to 13.6 percentage points. There area range of different costs that traders face, including broking fees, taxes and a range of pro-cessing costs, that create the spreads between buyer and seller prices. But these costs do notappear to be large enough to explain the equity premium puzzle.\\nIn an infinite horizon setting, Aiyagari and Gertler (1991) include differential transactions\\ncosts on debt and equity used by consumers to smooth idiosyncratic shocks to labourincome in the absence of formal insurance. When equity is relatively costly to trade, consumers use debt to offset these income shocks. And this is consistent with the highturnover rates for debt and the low turnover rates for equity in financial markets. Aiyagari andGertler find that debt in the US turns over on average between three and seven times eachyear, depending on the type of debt instrument, while equity turnover is negligible. Since self-insurance relies on trading both debt and equity, relatively large transactions costs onequity leave consumers with higher individual consumption risk.

       " Document(page_content='explanation for the pricing puzzles in Constantinides and Duffie where dynamic self-insur-\\nance cannot eliminate persistent shocks to labour income. The higher risk in individual con-sumption explains the equity premium, while the demand for debt to smooth the variance infuture consumption reduces the interest rate.\\nSwan (2006) finds one-way transactions costs as small as 0.5 percentage point on equity\\ncan explain both pricing puzzles due to the (invisible) costs of forgone equity trades at 5.7 per cent of value. These marginal costs arise from inefficient risk sharing in the pres-ence of differential trading costs, and are approximately 15 times higher than the observedtrading costs. Debt turnover rises significantly, due to its lower transactions costs, to matchthe lower net marginal gain from spreading risk with equity, but without the same risk-sharing benefits. Thus, individual consumption risk is higher than aggregate consumptionrisk, and there is a lower interest.\\nAs noted earlier, explanations for the equity premium and low interest rate puzzles can be\\ndivided between those that seek to extend the CCAPM by modifying consumer preferences,and those that allow different individual consumption risk. Grant and Quiggin (2004) arguethere are potentially large differences in the welfare and policy implications of these ex-planations. Whenever the observed risk premium and the low risk-free rate are equilibriumoutcomes in an efficient capital market, there are no potential welfare-improving policies.Habit formation, transactions costs and preferences that separate risk aversion fromintertemporal substitution are explanations that fall into this category. In contrast, explana-tions based on market failure or investor irrationality may provide opportunities for welfare-improving policies if governments can overcome market failure or improve on irrationalprivate outcomes.\\nGrant and Quiggin argue that, whenever governments can eliminate idiosyncratic risk in\\nlabour income at lower cost than private traders using the tax system, the discount rate onpublic sector projects is marginally higher than the risk-free interest rate.\\n46As a conse-\\nquence, welfare can be raised through tax-funded public investment. Similarly, if privatefinancial markets for trading aggregate risk are incomplete, then, consistent with proposalsby Arrow and Lind (1970), the cost of capital for investment in the public sector will belower than it is for the private sector undertaking the same projects when the governmentcan spread aggregate risk more efficiently. Indeed, Grant and Quiggin link the implicationsof the equity premium puzzle to the arguments made by Arrow and Lind to identify poten-tially large welfare gains from macroeconomic stabilization policies that reduce fluctuationsin aggregate income.\\nThere are, however, good reasons to be cautious about this claim. First, the scope for gov-\\nernments to diversify risk more efficiently than private markets seems rather optimistic.\\n47It\\nis difficult to find circumstances where agents in the public sector are better informed andbetter placed to overcome asymmetric information, or trade at lower transactions costs, thanprivate agents. But even in circumstances where they can, governments have difficultyimplementing stabilization policies to counteract the effects of the business cycle on economic activity. Indeed, they have trouble identifying turning points in the business cycle,as well as problems implementing the appropriate tax-spending changes in a timely manner.Additionally, there are principal–agent problems in the public sector that make it a notoriously inefficient operator, where any potential welfare gains from a lower cost ofcapital can be offset by a lower marginal productivity of investment in the public sector. Forexample, managers of public enterprises face soft budget constraints and frequently succumb to excessive union-backed wage demands, particularly when politicians are sensi-tive to disruptions that impact adversely on their voter support.150 Asset pricing models', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 162}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='A logical implication of explanations for the large equity premium that gives the public\\nsector a lower cost of capital, is that all aggregate investment should be financed throughthe public sector. Indeed, this would also be the case when loss aversion explains the largeequity premium. By using taxes to finance investment we avoid the financial losses on privately issued securities. But that is unlikely to lower the cost of capital when taxpayerssuffer loss aversion from the risk transferred into their taxes.\\n4.6 Present value calculations with risky discount factors\\nThere are a number of important issues to address when valuing capital assets with risky netcash flows. Frequently, they have revenues and costs with different risks that can changeover time. Moreover, aggregate consumption risk itself can change over time. This sectionlooks at how the consumption-based pricing models examined earlier in Section 4.3 are usedto value assets in these circumstances. Since consumers have common information theymeasure and price risk identically, and by employing mean–variance analysis there is alinear relationship between expected security returns and market risk premiums. While these properties simplify the task of computing risk-adjusted discount factors, it is notstraightforward to use them in present value calculations over multiple time periods, particularly when consumption risk can change over time.\\n4.6.1 Different consumption risk in the revenues and costs\\nIt is not uncommon for assets, and projects more generally, to have revenue streams \\nwith more or less risk than the costs of generating them. Indeed, these differences are identified by managers of statutory monopolies when regulatory agencies impose ceilingson their prices to restrict monopoly profits. When revenues are more risky than costs, man-agers seek less restrictive price caps so they can pay a risk premium to their capitalproviders.\\nConsider share kwhich pays a random dividend in 12 months’ time when the share\\nexpires. It is funded from net cash flows generated by the firm who issued the share,and is the difference between its risky revenues  and costs per share.

       " Document(page_content='5 Private insurance with \\nasymmetric information\\nThere are a number of different sources for the risk in consumption expenditure.\\nConsumers hold securities with risky returns and have variable income from labour andother capital assets. Diversifiable risk in security returns is eliminated by bundling them\\ntogether in portfolios, whereas most of the diversifiable risk in their labour and otherincome is eliminated by purchasing insurance. We examined the diversification effect\\ninside portfolios of securities earlier in Chapter 3. In this chapter we look at the role ofinsurance where consumers pool individual risk that can be eliminated across the popula-tion by the law of large numbers. Individual risk is where a portion of the population incurs\\nincome losses that do not affect aggregate consumption. The only uncertainty is over theidentity of the consumers in the group incurring losses. In a frictionless competitive marketwhere insurance trades at prices equal to the probability of incurring losses, consumerswith state-independent preferences fully insure to eliminate individual risk from their con-sumption expenditure. In effect, consumers pay premiums into a pool of funds that coverthe insurance claims made by the proportion of the population incurring losses. Wheninsurance trades at these actuarially fair prices there is no expected cost to consumers from\\nremoving individual risk from their consumption expenditure so they fully insure. Whenindividual risk can be costlessly eliminated in this way it attracts no premium, where theonly premium in expected security returns is determined by aggregate non-diversifiablerisk. This is referred to as the mutuality principle that holds in all the consumption-based\\nasset pricing models examined earlier in Chapter 4.\\nWe look at insurance with common (symmetric) information in Section 5.1 and then\\nextend the analysis by introducing asymmetric information in Section 5.2. Consumers will\\nfully insure against individual risk in a frictionless competitive equilibrium when tradershave common information and state-independent preferences. We use this as a benchmarkto identify the effects of trading costs and asymmetric information. Consumers choose notto fully insure when trading costs raise the price of insurance above the probability of incur-ring losses. When they are minimum necessary costs of trade the competitive equilibriumoutcome is Pareto efficient, where expected security returns rise to compensate consumersfor the cost of eliminating individual risk from their consumption expenditure.\\nA number of government policies, including price stabilization schemes and publicly\\nfunded insurance, are justified as ways to overcome the effects of asymmetric informationon private insurance. Moral hazard and adverse selection are the most widely cited prob-lems. With moral hazard consumers have the ability to reduce their individual risk by under-\\ntaking costly self-protection. Whenever marginal effort, which cannot be observed byinsurers, is not reflected in the price consumers pay for insurance, they less than fully insure.Adverse selection occurs when there are consumers with different probabilities of incurring', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 173}),\n",

This imposes externalities on low-risk consumers. Atone extreme high-risk types may prove too big a problem for the existence of a private insur-ance market. These are the most common reasons cited for incomplete insurance markets.Newbery and Stiglitz (1981) argue that moral hazard and adverse selection problems areespecially severe in developing countries and they recommend the use of price stabilizationpolicies to reduce the risk in consumer incomes. Dixit (1987, 1989) argues, however, thatthese stabilization policies should be evaluated in the presence of the moral hazard andadverse selection problems. Unless governments have better information than privatetraders, or can trade risk more efficiently, the stabilization policies are unlikely to be sociallybeneficial.\\nBefore we commence the formal analysis it is helpful to illustrate the difference between\\naggregate uncertainty and individual risk.\\n1Aggregate uncertainty is economy-wide non-\\ndiversifiable risk which agents trade according to their differing risk preferences, while indi-\\nvidual risk is diversifiable across the economy by the law of large numbers. The difference\\nbetween them can be illustrated in consumer budget constraints. Consider a situation whereevery individual has the same endowment of money income, in each state of nature s.\\nSince it can vary across states of nature they face aggregate uncertainty. Now suppose theycan also suffer a loss Lwith probability πin each state s, where the income for each \\nconsumer becomes\\nfor the bad ( B) outcome, and\\nfor the good ( G) outcome without the loss with probability 1 −π.\\nWhen a large number of consumers ( H) have the same probability of loss π, aggregate\\nincome in each state will be equal to their expected income multiplied by the number of consumers,\\nWithin each state aggregate income is non-stochastic as a fixed proportion πof the pop-\\nulation always has low income, while the remaining proportion 1 -πof the population\\nalways has high income. Thus, there is scope in this setting for mutual insurance amongconsumers to eliminate their individual risk. The combined effects of aggregate uncer-tainty and individual risk on consumer income are illustrated in a two-period setting withthree states of nature in Figure 5.1, where individual risk doubles the number of randomoutcomes for consumers. In each state of nature bad outcomes occur with probability p\\ns×π, and good outcomes in each state with probability ps×(1−π).2The analysis could\\nbe generalized by allowing loss Land its probability to both be state-dependent, but that\\nwould complicate things without providing much additional insight into the followingresults.ππ πMs MsH M s L HBG() ( ) () () .+− ( )=−( ) 1Ms M sG() ()=Ms M s LB() ()=−Ms() ,162 Private insurance with asymmetric information', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 174}),\n",

In many situationsconsumers can change these probabilities and/or the size of any losses by expending effort.Moreover, they can have different loss probabilities. For example, drivers have differentskills and other attributes that give them different accident probabilities, and the probabilityof having a car accident can be reduced by driving more carefully and in good weather con-ditions. When information is costly to obtain insurers can have incomplete (asymmetric)information about these probabilities, and this can lead to equilibrium outcomes where someconsumers have less than full insurance. Two cases are considered in this section, moralhazard and adverse selection.\\n6\\n5.2.1 Moral hazard\\nIn most practical situations consumers can take actions to reduce expected losses in\\nincome from individual risk. They take precautions to reduce the probability of loss throughself-protection , or the size of the loss incurred through self-insurance . We look at how they\\nimpact on the demand for market insurance using the analysis in Ehrlich and Becker (1972).When competitive insurers can costlessly observe marginal reductions in the probability ofincome losses they adjust their insurance premiums accordingly, and consumers fully insure.Private insurance with asymmetric information 169\\nBox 5.2 Administrative costs and insurance: a numerical example\\nSuppose insurers incur a constant marginal cost of τP=0.2 on each dollar of insurance they sell\\nto Leonard in Box 5.1, where the price he must now pay rises from $0.40 to c=π/(1 – τP) =\\n$0.50.

As noted in\\nChapter 3, these flows are subject to aggregate uncertainty and individual risk – aggregateuncertainty must ultimately be borne by consumers, while individual risk can be eliminatedthrough the diversification effect from holding securities in portfolios and by trading privateinsurance. In a complete capital market where the no arbitrage condition holds consumerscostlessly eliminate individual risk. In previous chapters no distinction was made betweenprimary financial securities, such as shares and bonds, and the derivative securities writtenon them, such as options and futures contracts. Derivatives have values that derive fromunderlying assets, both financial and physical, because they represent claims to them at pre-determined prices and times. Derivatives are normally thought of as financial securitieswhose values derive from one or a bundle of other financial securities, but the term is usedmore widely here to include options and futures contracts for commodities. There has beena large growth in derivative trades in recent years. Micu and Upper (2006) report a com-bined turnover in fixed income, equity index and currency contracts (including both optionsand futures) on international derivatives exchanges of $US344 trillion in the fourth quarterof 2005. Most financial contracts were for interest rates, government bonds, foreignexchange and stock indexes, while the main commodity contracts were for metals (particu-larly gold), agricultural goods and energy (particularly oil).\\nDerivative securities play a key role in facilitating trades in aggregate risk and allow-\\ning investors to diversify individual risk by completing the capital market. They also pro-vide valuable information about the expectations investors have for future values of theunderlying assets. An option contract gives the bearer the right to buy or sell an under-\\nlying asset at predetermined price on or before a specified date – a call option is the right\\nto buy the asset and a put option the right to sell it. They are not obliged to exercise these\\nrights, and do so only if it increases their wealth. In contrast, a forward contract is an\\nobligation to buy an underlying asset at a specified price and time. They are frequentlyimplicit contracts, where, for example, consumers commit to purchase a house or car ata future time at an agreed price, and most employers commit to pay wages and salariesfor labour services rendered to them. A futures contract is a standardized forward con-\\ntract that trades at official stock exchanges, such as the New Y ork Stock Exchange andthe Australian Securities Exchange. They can be traded repeatedly up to the settlementdate, where the gains and losses made on them are settled daily through a clearing house.To ensure they are liquid markets, traders are required to maintain deposits with them tocover expected daily gains and losses, and price limits are employed to restrict the sizeof daily changes in futures prices. Standardized options contracts also trade on formalexchanges.', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 195}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='A key objective in this chapter is to price these derivative securities. One approach would\\nbe to adopt an economic model that allows us to solve the stochastic discount factor in theconsumption-based pricing model in (4.28) and use it to value the payouts to derivatives.This is the approach adopted in the asset pricing models examined earlier in Chapter 4where restrictions were imposed on consumer preferences and the distributions of returns tosecurities to make the stochastic discount factor linear in a set of state variables reported inaggregate data. But the preferred approach obtains pricing models for derivatives as func-tions of the current values of the underlying asset prices, together with conditions specifiedin the contracts. Since the assets already trade we can use their current prices as inputs tothe pricing model without trying to compute them. In effect, this approach works from thepremise that markets price assets efficiently and all we need to do is work out how the deriv-atives relate to the underlying assets themselves.\\nIn Section 6.1 we summarize the peculiar features of options contracts and then present\\nthe Black and Scholes (1973) option pricing model. This values share options using fivevariables – the current share price, its variance, the expiry date, exercise price and the risk-free interest rate. It is a popular and widely used model because this information is readilyavailable, but it does rely on a number of important assumptions. For example, the varianceon the underlying share is constant and the option is a European call option which cannotbe exercised prior to expiration as is permissible for American options. There is evidencethat the variances in share prices change over time, and it may be optimal to exercise anAmerican option early when shares pay dividends.\\nAfter summarizing the defining features of futures contracts in Section 6.2 we look at\\nhow they are priced. Once again, their values are determined by the current price of theunderlying asset, the settlement date, margin requirements, price limits and storage costswhen the goods are storable. Commodity futures trade for agricultural commodities,metals and oil, while financial futures trade for interest rates, stock indexes, shares,bonds and foreign currencies. It is rare for the underlying assets to be delivered at settle-ment, and cash settlements are much more common. Traders who buy a futures contractcommit to pay the contract price for the underlying asset at settlement. When the futurespot price is less than the contract price the buyer pays the difference to the seller by wayof cash settlement, while the reverse applies when the future spot price is higher.Physical commodities may actually be delivered at settlement when they are used asinputs to production.\\n6.1 Option contracts\\nIn this section we focus on formal options contracts, but it is also important to recognizethe role of informal contracts in the allocation of resources. For example, firms may buyland that gives them the option of expanding activities in locations where availability ofland in the future is uncertain. If there are fixed sunk costs from undertaking activitieswith uncertain future payouts, there may be gains from delaying them until the uncer-tainty is partially resolved. There are welfare gains when the benefits from waitingexceed the costs of creating the option.\\n1In other circumstances options raise welfare by\\nallowing a more efficient allocation of risk between consumers. For example, shareoptions allow consumers to truncate the payouts on shares, as the contracts give them theright, but not the obligation, to trade them at (or before) a specified time and price.Specialized options contracts trade over the counter while standardized contracts tradeon formal exchanges.184 Derivative securities', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 196}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='6.1.1 Option payouts\\nThere are two types of options – a call that gives the buyer the right to purchase an under-\\nlying asset, and a put that gives the buyer the right to sell it. These contracts specify the fol-lowing conditions:\\n∑The underlying asset that can be traded at the discretion of the buyer. Most of the stan-\\ndardized financial contracts are for a fixed quantity of financial securities, such as indi-vidual shares, bonds, stock indexes and foreign exchange, while standardized commoditycontracts specify quantities of goods with defined qualities. Usually quality is determinedby setting bounds on their physical attributes.\\n∑The expiration date when the contract lapses.\\n∑The exercise (strike) price for the underlying asset when the contract lapses.\\nEuropean options can only be exercised when they expire, while American options can\\nbe exercised any time up to or at expiration. Later we identify realistic circumstanceswhere the American options will not be exercised early because the expected payouts arehigher from waiting. For that reason we examine European options in the followinganalysis and do so for an individual ordinary share ( S) in a publicly listed company.\\nHolders of call options on shares receive no dividends or voting rights until they exer-cise the option.

There are expected profits when thediscounted value of the option payouts exceed the option price. And this occurs when tradershave different information about the share price at the expiration date. In a frictionless com-petitive market with common information, arbitrage eliminates profit by equating optionprices to the discounted value of their payouts. When European share options are written theexercise price is usually set near the market price of the share (when it pays no dividends).If, at any time prior to expiration, the share price exceeds the exercise price the call optionis in the money , it is out of the money when the share price is lower, and at the money when\\nit is the same.

To simplify the analysis we focus on share options and then con-\\nsider how the pricing model changes for options on other assets.\\nIn a competitive capital market where the law of one price holds, Stoll (1969) uses (6.3)\\nto obtain the put–call parity relationship for European share options, given by\\nwhere the option contracts have the same exercise price, which is also the payout to the \\nrisk-free bond, with BT= ˆST. This is confirmed by using the option payouts in (6.1) and \\n(6.2), where\\nSince this parity relationship holds at expiration in every state of nature, it also holds for the\\ncurrent values of the assets, with:\\n(6.4)\\nwhere B0= ˆST/(1 +i)Tis the value of risk-free debt that pays  ˆSTwith certainty at the expiry\\ndate. This means there is no need to separately compute the prices of call and put options.Once we know the value of a call option we can use it, together with the share price andthe risk-free interest rate, to compute the value of the put option. For that reason we willfocus on pricing call options on shares in the following analysis. The same model can beused to price European and American call options when shares pay no dividends asAmerican options are not exercised early in these circumstances. This is demonstrated bycomparing the payouts on two portfolios of securities – one long in a share that pays nodividends and the other long in a call on the share and a zero coupon bond with a payoutequal to the exercise price on the call option ( ˆ S\\nT). At expiration the payout on the share \\nis less than the combined payout on the call and bond which means \\nthe market value of the share cannot exceed the market value of the call and bond at anytime t<T:\\nOn rearranging this expression, we can see why at any time t<Tthe market value of the call\\nmust be strictly greater than the payout from exercising the option early, with:\\nwhere traders maximize profit by holding options until they expire, or by selling them rather\\nthan exercising early.

Despite its apparent\\ncomplexity, there is good intuition for the functional relationships in (6.11). N(.) is the\\nstandard cumulative normal distribution function over the random variable z with mean\\nzero and unit standard deviation. It is the stochastic process that generates the variance inthe share price, where N(d\\n1) is the inverse of the hedge ratio (with N(d1) =∂C/∂S) and\\nN(d2) the probability the option will be in the money at expiration. On that basis we can\\ninterpret the value of the call in (6.11) as the market value of the shareholding required toreplicate the call S\\ntN(d1) less the present value of the implicit amount borrowed\\nˆSTe–iτN(d2).\\nWe can confirm the earlier conjecture about the way the five variables in (6.11) affect the\\nvalue of the option. It increases with a higher share price, interest rate, variance in the shareprice and expiration date. A larger variance and later expiration date both raise the value ofthe option by increasing the likelihood of it being in the money at expiration. Indeed, thetime value of the option derives from the variance in the share price which increases overtime. To see why this happens, consider the term It measures the standard deviationin the rate of return on the share price over the life of the option ( τ\\n∫T−t), and is a prop-\\nerty of the Wiener process that generates the uncertainty in the share price. In each in-finitesimally small time interval over the life of the option the share price can rise or fallproportionally by σ\\nSaround the expected increase of µS. Since it can rise (or fall) by σS\\naround this expected trend in every period, the variance over the life of the option contract(τ) becomes \\n, so that the standard deviation is Thus, the later the expiration\\ndate the larger is the variance in the return on the underlying share. A higher interest ratealso increases the option value because it reduces the current value of paying the exerciseprice, while a higher exercise price reduces the option value.\\nMerton (1973b) modifies the Black–Scholes option pricing model by including continu-\\nous dividend payments on the share and finds it is not optimal for traders to exercise early.Roll (1977b) achieves the same result by assuming dividend payments are known before-hand. Beyond these restrictions, however, the impact of dividends on the valuation ofAmerican call options is unclear. Similar problems arise for the valuation of American putoptions when the share price falls below the exercise price. As it gets closer to zero traderscan eventually do better by exercising early and investing the proceeds in bonds for theremaining time to expiration. Merton was also able extend the Black–Scholes model byallowing a stochastic interest rate, but not a stochastic variance in the share price or arandom maturity date. Cox et al. (1979) derive the Black–Scholes model using binomial dis-\\ntributions, while Cox and Ross (1976) extend it by allowing the variance in the share priceto change in a constant elasticity of variance model.\\n6.1.4 Empirical evidence on the Black –Scholes model\\nBlack and Scholes test their pricing model using data for over-the-counter options on secu-\\nrities traded in the Unites States between 1966 and 1969. They use their model to estimatethe expected prices of these contracts and compare them to the actual prices. Any differ-ences between them did not provide significant expected profit when combined inside thehedge portfolio. In particular, the profit could not be eliminated with transactions costs aslow as 1 per cent. Galai (1977) and Bhattacharya (1983) also find evidence supporting theability of the Black–Scholes model to predict option prices using data from the ChicagoBoard of Options Exchange. However, Macbeth and Merville (1979) and Beckers (1980)obtained better estimates of in-the-money options using the constant elasticity of varianceστS. στS2στS.', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 208}),\n",

Rubinstein (1985) concluded the\\nextensions to the Black–Scholes model could not explain all the bias in its estimates all the time.\\n6.2 Forward contracts\\nIt is common for consumers to make commitments to buy and sell commodities in futuretime periods. For example, they agree to trade major items like houses and cars in this way.Firms also contract to buy inputs ahead of time to ensure uninterrupted future productionflows and to reduce the variance in their costs, while others contract to sell their outputsahead of time to reduce the variance in their sales revenue. The seller of a forward contractagrees to deliver an underlying asset at a specified date (or, for commodity contracts, withina specified period of time) at a specified price. Many of these exchanges are implicit forward contracts while others are official, and the official contracts take one of two forms.The first are specialized forward contracts that trade between specified sellers and buyers\\nin over-the-counter trades, while the second are standardized futures contracts that trade on\\nofficial futures exchanges run by most stock exchanges.\\n7Over-the-counter contracts match\\nindividual buyers and sellers and are rarely traded between the time they are written and thedate they are settled. They are used by traders of assets where differences in quality areimportant to buyers. In contrast, buyers and sellers of futures contracts trade them frequentlyover this period but through an official futures exchange. There is no matching of buyersand sellers in futures markets because there is less variability in the quality of the underly-ing assets or their quality can be summarized in sufficient detail in standardized contracts.The underlying assets can be physical commodities, such as wheat, wool and metals, orfinancial securities, including individual shares, bonds, share indexes and foreign curren-cies. Clearly, financial securities are likely to be less variable in quality than commodities,and as a consequence are more easily accommodated in standardized futures contracts.Quality differences in some commodities can be summarized fairly accurately in standard-ized contracts as well. For example, wool can be described by a comprehensive set of char-acteristics such as colour, fibre length, fibre width, vegetable matter content, weight andyield, which are measured and reported at all the wool auctions in Australia. For that reason,wool futures are actively traded in Australia.\\nFutures contracts are highly liquid markets where gains and losses from movements in\\nfutures prices are settled daily through clearing houses operated by futures exchanges. Inother words, the gains and losses are marked to the market each trading day. The main\\nreason for doing this is to stop traders defaulting on their contracts, or at least, to limitthe losses when default occurs. To that end, futures traders are required to make initialdeposits and maintain them at margins that are expected to cover any daily losses.\\nAdditionally, bounds are set to limit the daily price changes on futures contracts, wherethe price limits are normally raised when they bind for a number of consecutive days.Without margins and price limits , futures traders can be exposed to very large losses\\nbecause they pay no price when the contract is initially written. This is a problem whenspeculators trade futures contracts solely for the purpose of making expected profits by\\nexploiting different information from the market. They make profits by combining theunderlying asset with its futures contract when they expect a future spot price for thecommodity at settlement different from the rest of the market. For example, if the marketexpects a lower future spot price the speculator can make profits by selling the futurescontract and buying the underlying asset.', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 209}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='198 Derivative securities\\nForward contracts play a number of important roles that facilitate the efficient allo-\\ncation of resources over time. Their prices are important signals about the expectationsmarket traders have for future prices of the underlying assets, where speculators canprofit from accessing new information. Another role is that of hedging , where traders\\nuse futures to transfer aggregate risk and eliminate individual risk. Farmers sell woolfutures to reduce the variance in their income, where they trade aggregate risk to agentswho specialize in risk bearing, and diversify individual risk across wool growers withuncorrelated production risk. Futures contracts are used to perform these functionswhen they do so at lower cost than other alternatives such as purchasing explicit insur-ance contracts.\\n6.2.1 Pricing futures contracts\\nWe now turn to the pricing of futures contracts, noting that prices of non-standarized for-\\nward contracts can be obtained as special cases. As stated earlier, no price is paid for afutures contract at the time it is written, where the contract price is the expected spot priceof the underlying asset at the date of settlement. In prior time periods the asset price nor-mally changes, thereby causing the futures price to change. For the most part, the underly-ing asset is not traded at settlement, but rather the difference between the contract and spotprice is paid in cash. If the contract price is higher, the buyer pays the difference to thefutures exchange which transfers it to the seller, while the reverse applies when it is lower.This ensures the seller always ends up being paid the contract price for the underlying assetat settlement. However, rather than wait until then, traders settle their gains and losses at theend of the each trading day based on the closing price of their contract. This is where thegains and losses are marked to market against deposits lodged at the futures exchange bytraders. In time periods closer to the settlement date the contract price approaches the under-lying asset price. Since there are fundamental differences between the payouts to commod-ity and financial futures contracts, we consider then separately.\\nA commodity futures contract that delivers a storable commodity (N) at settlement date T\\nhas a current price (\\n0FNT) equal to the current spot price of the commodity plus the oppor-\\ntunity cost of time and storage costs :\\n(6.12)\\nwhere iTis the average annual yield on a risk-free bond that matures at time T, and 0QNT\\nthe present value of the marginal cost of storing commodity Nover the period. As a way\\nto understand this relationship, consider a situation where storage is costless, so that 0FNT\\n=pN0(1 +iT)T. A trader who sells a futures contract commits to sell the commodity at time\\nTfor price 0FNT. By arbitrage in a frictionless capital market this price must be equal to\\nthe cost of borrowing funds at the risk-free rate to buy the good now at price pN0and to\\nhold it until time Twhen the contract expires. At this time the trader receives certain rev-\\nenue of 0FNTand retires the debt by paying pN0(1 +iT)T. Marginal storage costs raise the\\nfutures price because they increase the cost of transferring the commodity into the future.Hicks (1939) and Keynes (1923) refer to this arbitrage activity as hedging , while Kaldor\\n(1939) also includes a marginal convenience yield in the commodity futures contract price00 0 11 Fp i Q iNT N TT\\nNT TT =+ + + () () ,', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 210}),\n",

While con-\\nsumers borrow funds to purchase homes, cars and other capital assets, most private invest-ment is undertaken by corporate firms who sell a range of securities that are classified ingeneral terms as debt and equity instruments. Many of these securities are purchased bylarge institutional investors, such as insurance companies and mutual funds, who convertthem into derivative securities. As specialist finance institutions they facilitate resourceflows at lower cost, which has the potential to simultaneously raise the expected returnsreceived by consumers at each level of risk and to reduce the cost of capital for firms financ-ing risky investments. Consumers bundle securities together into portfolios to determinetheir future consumption risk, while institutional investors create derivative securities to sat-isfy consumer risk preferences and to earn profits from private information about the netcash flows of firms which are ultimately paid as security returns. By exploiting profitableopportunities they provide firm managers with a greater incentive to operate in the interestof their shareholders and bondholders, but these ideals may be compromised when there aretrading costs and asymmetric information.\\nBefore analysing the financial policy choices of firms we summarize the different ways\\nthey can raise funds for investment in Section 7.1. Many of the primary assets they sell areused by financial institutions to create a vast array of derivative securities that perform anumber of important wealth-creating roles, including the provision of risk-spreading serv-ices and transfers of information through arbitrage activity. The range of financial deci-sions made by firms can be separated into the capital structure choice, which determinesthe debt–equity mix for a given level of investment, and dividend policy, which determineshow income is distributed to investors as dividends, interest or capital gains. We examinecapital structure choices in Section 7.2 and dividend policy in Section 7.3. In both sectionsthe analysis starts in a classical finance model where investors with common informationtrade in frictionless competitive markets. In this setting the Modigliani–Miller (MM)\\nfinancial policy irrelevance theorems hold, so that real equilibrium outcomes in the econ-\\nomy are independent of the types of financial securities used to fund investment and ofthe way securities distribute their income. It provides a simple framework that can beextended to a more realistic setting in stages to identify the separate factors that determinethe optimal financial policy choices made by consumers and firms. These factors are difficult to isolate in a general model where taxes, trading costs and asymmetric informa-tion are included from the outset.

Most new share issues are publicly listed common shares with limited liabil-ity that trade on stock exchanges. When companies list their shares on a stock exchange theymust fulfil a number of important legal obligations. In particular, they must publish infor-mation at prescribed times each year and issue a prospectus with new share issues that provides important information to investors about the management of the finance and pro-duction activities of firms. Limited liability shares restrict the legal claims that can be madeagainst the wealth of shareholders to the value of their invested capital. This is importantbecause it limits the risk firm managers can impose on shareholders when they have lessinformation. But limited liability shares force bondholders to bear risk when losses exceedthe capital of shareholders, which is why there are default provisions in corporate law thatallow bondholders to file to have firms declared bankrupt when they cannot make theirinterest payments. Once bankruptcy claims are granted administrators are appointed torestrict the actions of managers.\\nThese important institutional features distinguish debt from equity, particularly in the\\npresence of uncertainty and asymmetric information. Even though bondholders have priorclaims to the net cash flows of firms, they face default risk when losses exceed the investedcapital of shareholders, while shareholders face risk, which is bounded by limited liability,because they have a residual claim on the net cash flows. But most shareholders have votingrights that allow them to influence the investment choices made by firm managers. Indeed,majority shareholders can take firms over by changing managers, merging them with otherfirms, or liquidating them. Another important difference between debt and equity arisesfrom the different taxes on their returns. For example, share income is taxed twice, whileinterest payments on debt are subject only to personal tax under a classical corporate taxsystem. Moreover, there are higher personal taxes on cash income paid as dividends andinterest than there are on capital gains in most countries.\\nWe examine the effects of these important institutional features on the financial policy\\nchoices of firms in the following sections.\\n7.2 Capital structure choice\\nAs owners, shareholders have the ability to affect the way firms operate, but without pro-viding all the capital, as debt allows them to leverage their control over firms. The factorsthat impact on this leverage policy can be isolated by first establishing conditions underwhich the Modigliani–Miller leverage irrelevance theorem holds.

In particular, it emphasizes the role of arbitrage that equates theexpected returns to securities in the same risk class. In this setting leverage policy is irrele-vant to the market value of firms. By extending the analysis to accommodate taxes and\\nasymmetric information , it is possible to identify circumstances where changes in leverage\\nhave real effects.\\nWhen Modigliani and Miller (1958) proved their irrelevance theorems they did not\\nexplicitly identify the need for common information . Indeed, it was implicit in much of the\\nanalysis of financial policy at that time. More recently, however, greater emphasis has beenplaced on the role of asymmetric information. If investors have less information than man-agers about the net cash flows of firms, their financial structure choices can have real effectsby signalling new information, or by changing the incentives facing managers and the deci-sions they make. In these circumstances leverage policy can change the cost of capital andaffect a firm’ s market valuation.\\nModigliani and Miller (1963) extended their earlier analysis by including a classical cor-\\nporate tax. Since it falls on income paid to shareholders by making interest payments tax-deductible expenses, it drives equity out of the corporate capital market in a classicalfinance model without leverage–related costs . In a competitive capital market all corporate\\nincome is paid to consumers through the lowest tax channel as interest. Thus, no tax revenueis raised by the corporate tax as firms issue only debt in these circumstances. Clearly, otherfactors must offset this tax advantage of debt to explain the significant amount of equitythat trades in most capital markets. Prior to the irrelevance theorems of Modigliani andMiller (1958, 1961) the finance literature examined the role of leverage-related costs, and,in particular, that of default costs, in determining the optimal debt–equity choices of firms.As they increase leverage there is a greater probability of defaulting on interest paymentswhen shares have limited liability. And this occurs because there is variability in the firms’net cash flows which must eventually spill over onto debt at high levels of leverage. Whenbondholders know how risky the debt becomes, its price sells at a discount to compensatethem for the default risk, where leverage is irrelevant to the cost of capital and the marketvaluation of the firm. But when bondholders have less information than firm managersabout this risk, bond prices may not discount sufficiently to properly compensate them.Most countries write bankruptcy provisions in their corporate laws as a way to protectbondholders in these circumstances. The associated default costs are third party claims onfirm net cash flows that reduce the value of the firm to its capital providers. Once marginalexpected default costs offset the interest tax deduction on debt, corporate firms also sellequity, where an optimal capital structure trades off marginal leverage-related costs against\\nthe interest tax deductions.\\nClearly, bankruptcy costs rely on asymmetric information, but that was not recognized\\nexplicitly until the more recent literature identified other forms of leverage-related costs. Moststudies examine the role of agency costs when firm financial policy alters the incentives facingcapital providers and firm managers in an asymmetric information setting. For example, therecan be principal–agent problems when it is costly for bondholders and shareholders to monitor the actions of firm managers, where higher leverage increases interest payments andreduces the free cash flows that can be used by managers for private gain. Harris and Raviv(1991) provide a comprehensive summary of the agency costs that change with leverage.\\nLost corporate tax shields are another source of leverage-related costs, but they can arise\\nin a common information setting. In most countries profits and losses are not treated sym-metrically by the classical corporate tax, which taxes profits without making tax refunds 206 Corporate finance', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 218}),\n",

When firms cannot sell their tax losses to other firms orcarry them forward at interest, they lose the real value of their tax deductions. And since taxlosses occur when firms default, the expected value of these lost corporate tax shields riseswith leverage.\\nEarlier empirical work by Warner (1977) and Altman (1984) showed that the default\\ncosts were considerably less than the interest tax deductions on debt. This led people toseek other explanations for use of equity in the presence of a classical corporate tax. Miller(1977) likened them to the rabbit in a horse and rabbit stew, and responded by includingpersonal taxes on security returns. Prior studies focused on factors affecting firms andignored those affecting investors – in particular, the role of personal taxes. This is probablybecause they (perhaps implicitly) adopted a partial equilibrium analysis to examine thefinancial decisions made by firms. Miller recognized the importance of including demand-side factors and exploited two important features of personal tax codes to explain the pres-ence of equity: first, marginal cash tax rates are progressive where different consumershave different tax rates on security returns; and second, taxes on capital gains are lowerthan taxes on cash income. Thus, it is possible for high-tax consumers (with cash tax ratesabove the corporate rate) to prefer equity that pays capital gains, even though they are taxedtwice, once at the corporate rate and then again at the personal tax rate. Since low-taxinvestors must have a tax preference for debt both securities trade in the Miller equilibrium,where investors form strict tax clienteles. When both securities trade leverage irrelevanceholds for individual firms in this setting. The analysis is general enough to accommodateuncertainty because there is common information and no trading costs in a competitivecapital market.\\nSubsequent empirical studies by Graham (2000) and Molina (2005) find evidence of\\nlarger expected default costs when indirect bankruptcy costs are also taken into account.They use information provided by debt rating agencies to get estimates of the default prob-abilities which they apply to their estimates of the costs of default.\\nIn the following subsections we examine the important role of taxes and risk in firm\\ncapital structure choices, starting with the results obtained by Modigliani and Miller.\\n7.2.1 Certainty with no taxes\\nWe begin by proving the Modigliani–Miller leverage policy irrelevance theorem in a cer-\\ntainty setting without taxes. While the outcome is fairly obvious in this setting, the analysisprovides an ideal opportunity to establish a simple methodology for analysing more compli-cated cases in following sections. As a way to identify the factors impacting on equilibriumoutcomes we obtain separate relationships between security returns that would make con-sumers and firms indifferent to debt and equity. (These are the demand and supply condi-tions, respectively, discussed below.) Much of the early analysis in corporate financefocused on factors affecting firms without explicitly recognizing the important role of fac-tors affecting consumers. And this is especially important when taxes are included in theanalysis. The approach we use is formalized by the demand and supply conditions, as wellas the equilibrium condition, which identifies the relationship between the market returns todebt and equity in a competitive capital market equilibrium.\\nThe two-period certainty model of an asset economy in Section 2.2.5 is extended here by\\nallowing consumers and firms to trade two risk-free securities, debt ( B) and equity ( E),\\nwhere the current market value of the portfolio held by each consumer ( h) is p\\naB ah\\nB + paE ah\\nE,', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 219}),\n",

We initially demonstrate leverage irrelevance in an economy without taxes by using the CAPM pricing equation, and later generalize it in the Arrow–Debreu model outlined inSection 3.1.3.\\nSince investors have homogeneous expectations and trade in a frictionless competitive\\ncapital market in the CAPM, leverage simply redistributes given project risk between shareholders and bondholders without affecting the value of the firm. Investors know whatthe firm’ s project risk is, and how it is distributed by leverage policy between debt and equity, where changes in their expected security returns must reflect changes in riskbearing without altering the total risk premium firms pay.

Bankruptcy andagency costs both require asymmetric information, while lost corporate tax shields do not.Each of them is now considered in turn, beginning with bankruptcy costs .\\nWhen firms issue limited liability shares, their debt eventually becomes risky at high levels\\nof leverage. Default occurs whenever their net cash flows fall below the risk-free interest pay-ments on their debt. As leverage rises, the probability of default eventually becomes positiveand increases. However, in a common information setting there are no default costs becausebondholders know ex ante how much project risk they bear and bond prices sell at a discountto compensate them. They cannot, in these circumstances, make legal claims against firmswhen default occurs as they knew about risk at the time they purchased the debt. But with asym-metric information bondholders may not be aware of the default risk when they purchase debt.Once it occurs they can then make claims against firms by applying to have them declaredbankrupt. Provisional administrators are appointed to determine whether the firms should bereorganized or liquidated. Any associated costs are third party claims on their net cash flowsthat reduce the funds available to bondholders and shareholders.

For example, Haugen and\\nSenbet (1978) argue they are limited to the lesser of the costs of going bankrupt and thecosts of avoiding it. When bankruptcy occurs ownership and control of the firm are trans-ferred to bondholders, and firms can avoid this outcome by selling new shares and using thefunds to repurchase fixed claims on their assets. This makes bankruptcy costs the lesser ofthe costs of transferring ownership and control to bondholders or new shareholders.\\nTwo important issues are ignored by this analysis; the first is how default costs impact on\\nconsumption risk, while the second is the role of agency costs when there is asymmetricinformation. Notice how default costs increase the downside risk in the net cash flows inFigure 7.2. If this changes the non-diversifiable risk in the payouts to investors additionalterms will appear in (7.24) to accommodate the resulting changes in the expected returns todebt and equity. Agency costs are examined later in this subsection.\\n14\\nLost corporate tax shields are examined by DeAngelo and Masulis (1980a) in an\\nArrow–Debreu economy with a full set of primitive securities and common information. Inmost countries corporate tax treats income and losses differently, where tax is collected onincome but not refunded (in full) on losses. Table 7.1 summarizes the state-contingentreturns paid to debt and equity after corporate tax, where the states of nature are assignednumbers that rise with the net cash flows. Default occurs in states where at thenet cash flows just cover the payouts to debt, with The tax losses are equalto the amount by which the tax-deductible expenses exceed the net cash flows, with [ ibV\\n0−\\nV0] −Ys≥0.

Governments rarely pay tax refunds or allow firms to sell their taxlosses. Most, however, do allow firms to carry their tax losses forward, but without interest.\\n16\\nThus, in periods when firms have tax losses, the present value of their tax deductions iseroded.

Jensen and Meckling (1976) identify two sources of conflict. The first arises betweenshareholders and managers, while the second is between shareholders and bondholders.Since managers receive only a portion of the residual claim on the firm’ s net cash flows theydo not reap the entire benefit from maximizing profit, whereas they bear the full cost of forgoing private benefits from perquisites, such as bigger offices and more personal staff.Thus, they have an incentive to consume private benefits at the expense of shareholderprofit. Higher leverage can reduce this agency cost by absorbing free cash flows in higher\\ninterest payments and by raising the share of equity held by firm managers.\\nConflicts arise between shareholders and bondholders due to limited liability, where\\nshareholders have an incentive to invest in more risky projects when downside risk is shiftedonto bondholders. But bondholders rationally anticipate this behaviour and discount theprice of debt, thereby reducing the payouts to shareholders. This asset substitution effect is\\nan agency cost of debt.\\n18\\nLeverage can be used to convey private (or insider) information to the capital market.\\nMyers and Majluf (1984) argue that when new investors have less information about thevalue of a firm’ s assets than existing investors they can discount the price of new equitybelow the present value of the profit from new investment. Existing shareholders avoid theselosses by rejecting the projects so that firms are forced to use lower-cost internal funds anddebt. Myers (1984) refers to this as a pecking order theory . Ross (1977b) argues that if man-\\nagers benefit from shares having high values and lose when firms default they will have anincentive to use capital structure to convey private information to the capital market. Firm’ swith high-quality net cash flows (based on first-order stochastic dominance) will have alower probability of default and can justify higher leverage than lower-quality firms. Thisleverage choice is a signal of quality to the capital market. Leland and Pyle (1977) arguethat with managerial risk aversion managers are also less willing to hold a larger share ofequity from increases in leverage unless the firm has high-quality projects.\\nIn summary, leverage policy can affect the market valuation of firms when there are\\nagency costs and information signalling, where optimally chosen leverage equates the mar-ginal costs and benefits of reducing agency costs and providing valuable information to the capital market.

Warner (1977) estimated the direct bank-ruptcy costs for 11 failed railroad firms in the US and found they averaged 1 per cent ofmarket value 7 years prior to bankruptcy and rose to 5.3 per cent of market value just before-hand. Subsequent studies obtained higher estimates by including indirect bankruptcy costs,such as the loss of goodwill and other intangible assets in defaulting firms. Altman (1984)used data for 19 industrial companies in the US and obtained estimates of default costs thatranged from 11 to 17 per cent of market value 3 years prior to default. Alderson and Betker(1995) found they were 35 per cent of value at the time firms were being restructured, whileAndrade and Kaplan (1998) obtained estimates of 10 to 23 per cent of value for a group ofhighly geared firms.\\nGraham (2000) used these estimates to compute expected default costs and found a typ-\\nical firm could increase its market value by 7.5 per cent by raising leverage to its optimallevel, where ex-post default costs were multiplied by estimates of the probability of defaultCorporate finance 225', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 237}),\n",

They claim marginal investors are needed in the model to absorb changes in firm capital structure, while certainty removes risk preferences from security demands so thatconsumers divide into strict tax clienteles.\\n27But leverage irrelevance holds in the Miller\\nequilibrium without marginal investors and with uncertainty.\\nSuppose there are no marginal investors in a certainty setting, so that all consumers are\\ndebt or equity specialists. If one firm raises its leverage (with investment held constant)there is an excess supply of debt and an excess demand for equity that puts upward pressureon the market price of equity and downward pressure on the market price of debt. Otherfirms respond to these price changes by substituting equity for debt until the aggregatedebt–equity ratio is restored to its original level. Thus, the market value of individual firmsis unaffected by changes in leverage as changes in security prices induce other firms to takeoffsetting positions so that consumers continue to hold their tax –preferred securities. In a\\nfrictionless competitive capital market where profit-maximizing firms respond to securityprice changes consumers get their tax-preferred securities.\\nStiglitz (1974) recognized that rebundling by financial intermediaries (as agents of cor-\\nporate firms) would make leverage policy irrelevant in a frictionless competitive capitalmarket without taxes.\\n28Even in the absence of personal taxes and short-selling constraints,\\nhomemade leverage is likely in practice to be more costly than rebundling on the supply sideof the market by specialist traders with lower transactions costs. While there are no transac-tions costs in the Miller equilibrium, there are borrowing constraints on consumers to boundtheir security demands and rule out tax arbitrage. Thus, all the arbitrage activity must beundertaken by profit-maximizing firms.\\nNow suppose we introduce uncertainty to the earlier analysis of the Miller equilibrium. It\\nis tempting to conclude consumers will not separate into strict tax clienteles in these circum-stances as their security demands will be determined by a combination of risk and tax pref-erences. Auerbach and King argue consumers will forgo some of the benefits from holdingtax-preferred securities and bundle debt and equity together to satisfy their risk preferences.In response, firms will form leverage clienteles to create different risky mutual funds forconsumers with the same tax preferences. They argue these mutual funds are unlikely to satisfy the risk preferences of every consumer. Kim (1982) and Sarig and Scott (1985) arguethere are no leverage clienteles in the Miller equilibrium because consumers can satisfy theirrisk preferences by holding just tax-preferred securities. There are two ways firms (or finan-cial intermediaries) achieve this outcome: by providing a complete set of debt and equitysecurities so that consumers can create a full set of primitive equity and primitive debt secu-rities; or by creating securities to satisfy the risk and tax preferences of consumers (in effect,they create personalized mutual funds constructed solely from tax-preferred securities).\\nWhile the outcome in Auerbach and King is more realistic, they are implicitly including\\ntransactions costs and asymmetric information to stop firms from creating personalizedrisky mutual funds for consumers. Clearly, they are trying to explain what actually happensin the capital market, but, in doing so, are moving outside the confines of the frictionlessclassical finance model of the Miller equilibrium. In a frictionless competitive economywith common information, firms know the risk and tax preferences of every consumer and are driven by the profit motive to satisfy them.

In\\npractice, consumers do purchase bundles of debt and equity, often as mutual funds, to sat-isfy their conflicting risk and tax preferences as firms cannot costlessly create their person-alized risky tax-preferred securities.\\n29Moreover, it is too costly for them to create a full set\\nof primitive debt and equity securities to make the capital market double complete . This is\\nconfirmed by Kim et al (1979) who find empirical evidence of shareholder leverage clien-\\nteles, where firms choose capital structures to satisfy investors with different risk and taxpreferences. Even though leverage clienteles are absent in the Miller equilibrium, it does,however, establish the important arbitrage activity by firms (or their agents financial inter-mediaries) in competitive capital markets. In practice, trading costs are likely to restricthomemade leverage, where consumers face higher trading costs than specialist financialintermediaries. As transactions costs fall and traders acquire better information aboutinvestor risk and tax preferences the actual capital market outcome will converge to theMiller equilibrium.\\nMM leverage irrelevance for individual firms in the Miller equilibrium with uncertainty\\ncan be confirmed by computing the market value of firms in the Arrow–Debreu economy asBox 7.14 The Miller equilibrium without marginal investors\\nA geometric analysis helps to clarify the reason why marginal investors are not required in the\\nMiller equilibrium. In their absence there is an optimal aggregate debt–equity bundle for thecorporate sector of the economy at aˆon the asset production frontier R\\nCRCin the debt–equity\\nspace diagram below. Since consumers face borrowing constraints to restrict tax arbitrage theyare unable to access any arbitrage profits when the after-tax security returns are not equal.Instead, that role is undertaken by profit-maximizing firms which equate the cost of debt andequity along the frontier R\\nCRC, with iB(1 −tC) =iG. Whenever changes in leverage by one or\\nmore firms moves the aggregate debt–equity bundle away from aˆ, other firms respond to the\\n(incipient) changes in security prices and bring the bundle back to aˆwhere consumer tax pref-\\nerences are satisfied. Profit-maximizing firms undertake this repackaging due to the absenceof restrictions on their security trades, which is reflected in the linearity of the asset productionfrontier.

We conclude this section by considering\\nthree of them.\\nFirst, investor demands are affected by personal taxes on the returns to debt and equity.\\nIn the previous subsection we saw how the double tax on dividends makes interest and cap-ital gains more attractive for all investors. Corporate and personal taxes affect the relativereturns to debt and equity as well as their equilibrium levels. From the supply condition in(7.27), with i\\nBs(1 −tC) =iDs=iGs for all s, we have iBs>iDs=iGsdue to the tax deductibility\\nof interest. The combined corporate and personal taxes drive wedges between the pre- and post-tax returns to debt and equity, thereby raising the cost of capital for firms and lowering the after-tax income received by investors; the larger the tax wedges, the lower theaggregate level of saving and investment.\\nInvestors divide into strict tax clienteles in the Miller equilibrium to minimize their tax\\npayments. Recall from the previous subsection how this occurs in a common informationsetting without transactions costs where consumers effectively have access to a full set ofprimitive debt and primitive equity securities. However, investors may bundle debt andequity together and incur larger tax burdens to satisfy their risk preferences when there aretrading costs and asymmetric information. This further reduces saving and investment bysimultaneously raising the cost of capital for firms and reducing the after-tax returns toinvestors.\\nFrom time to time governments reform their spending and taxing policies to expand\\naggregate income and employment. Lower corporate and personal tax rates expand pri-vate investment and saving by reducing the cost of capital and raising the after-tax returnsto investors. The final change in the cost of capital in (7.22) is ultimately determined bythe interest elasticities of aggregate investment demand and aggregate saving.\\n34A lower\\ncorporate tax rate reduces the value of interest tax deductions. When it falls below thelowest marginal cash tax rate every investor becomes a high-tax investor, with\\nwhere this is likely to increase the number of equity specialists in the\\nMiller equilibrium.\\nSecond, governments in some countries allow firms in politically sensitive sectors of the\\neconomy to accelerate their depreciation deductions for tax purposes. While this providesan implicit subsidy by raising the present value of their tax deductions relative to firms inother sectors, it has efficiency effects that can reduce aggregate income. Concessions of thiskind are fairly common in relatively new industries and for firms which undertake researchand development. When the implicit subsidy from accelerated depreciation allowances cor-rects externalities in these activities it can raise aggregate income. But they too are fre-quently granted on political rather than efficiency grounds.\\nThird, fiscal and monetary policies can also impact on the user cost of capital by chang-\\ning the equilibrium returns to debt and equity. For example, tighter monetary policy candrive up the cost of capital and discourage investment, at least in the short term when thereare nominal price rigidities that allow changes in the money supply to have real effects inthe economy. Extra government spending can also affect the user cost of capital when it real-locates resources inter-temporally. In recent years governments have been much lessinclined to use fiscal and monetary policies to smooth economic activity through normalcyclical changes. They have difficulty identifying the cycles, and it also takes considerabletime to legislate and implement their policy responses. Moreover, monetary policy is muchless effective in economies with flexible nominal prices, while government spending may beineffective when there are principal–agent problems between voters, politicians and bureau-crats that affect the provision of public services.tt hBh\\nC>for all ,', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 248}),\n",

This was demonstrated earlier in Section 7.2.3,where no dividends are paid in the Miller equilibrium.\\n35A large number of studies have\\nattempted to solve the dividend puzzle . In recent years a number of governments have\\nreplaced the classical corporate tax with an imputation tax system that grants credits toshareholders for corporate tax collected on their dividends; it removes the double taxationof dividends and makes them subject to the same personal tax as interest income.\\n36It may\\nseem puzzling that they did not instead just abolish the corporate tax altogether. But thereason for not doing so is the same as the reason for introducing a corporate tax in the firstplace. In its absence firms have an incentive to pay equity income as capital gains that aresubject to lower personal tax rates. Recall from an earlier discussion that there are two rea-sons why: first, most governments set lower statutory rates on them relative to cash income;and second, they are taxed on realization and not accrual. The more time it takes to realizecapital gains, the lower the effective tax rate on them. The imputation tax system recognizesthis by using the corporate tax as a withholding tax which is credited to shareholders whenthey receive the income as dividends. Thus, it taxes equity income on accrual inside firmsand removes any incentive for then to delay paying it as capital gains (when shareholdershave marginal personal (cash) tax rates less than or equal to the corporate tax rate).Governments are attracted to the imputation tax system because it removes the double taxation of dividends under the classical corporate tax system and, in so doing, is a less discriminatory tax. There are some remaining tax preferences, however, and they will beidentified later in this section.\\nWe begin the analysis with a simple proof of MM dividend policy irrelevance in the\\nabsence of taxes. Then we summarize the dividend puzzle identified earlier in the Millerequilibrium before considering a number of attempts to resolve it, including, differentialtransactions costs on dividends and capital gains, share repurchase constraints and agencycosts. Unfortunately, none on these explanations appear to provide an adequate resolutionto the puzzle, which is why many argue it is one of the most intractable problems infinance.\\n7.3.1 Dividend policy irrelevance\\nDividend policy irrelevance can be demonstrated in a two-period certainty setting by sepa-\\nrating equity into shares that pay dividends ( D) and capital gains ( G), where the optimal debt\\nand equity choices of consumers and firms satisfy\\n(7.30)\\nleading to an equilibrium condition when the no arbitrage condition holds, of\\nϕ\\nϕ() , ,11+=\\n+=i\\niB\\nDfor debt\\n(1 ) 1, for equity payi ing dividends,\\n(1 ) 1, for equity payingϕ+ = iG ccapital gains,238 Corporate finance', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 250}),\n",

Clearly, when the\\nequilibrium condition in (7.31) holds, the value of the firm is unaffected by changes inleverage or dividend policy.\\n7.3.2 The dividend puzzle\\nMiller (1988) identified the dividend puzzle by combining corporate and personal taxes in\\na classical finance model. Under a classical corporate tax, dividends are subject to highertax than all other forms of corporate income for fully taxable consumers who prefer inter-est or capital gains. But this creates an obvious dilemma because in practice corporatefirms pay a significant proportion of their income as dividends. In a sample of 156 USfirms, Sarig (2004) found that on average they distributed approximately 61 per cent oftheir earnings, with approximately 91 per cent being paid as dividends over the period1950–1997.\\n38The dividend puzzle was isolated earlier in the Miller equilibrium using\\n(7.28), where\\nThe double tax on dividends makes them preferable to interest, which is subject only to \\npersonal tax, and capital gains, which are subject to lower personal tax. For that reason, nodividends are paid in the Miller equilibrium.\\nThere have been a number of attempts to resolve the dividend puzzle. Three main expla-\\nnations are considered here. The first of these is trading costs . Firms and shareholders incur\\ntransactions costs such as bank fees, mailing charges and stamp duty when dividends arepaid. In contrast, firms that repurchase shares to pay capital gains must by law provide infor-mation about these transactions, pay broking fees and incur other transactions costs, whileshareholders also incur broking fees and other transactions costs when they sell their shares.The trading costs to pay capital gains are typically much larger than the costs of paying div-idends, particularly for individual shareholders. According to Barclay and Smith (1988) theyare higher for capital gains, but not by enough at the margin to offset the extra tax burdenimposed on dividends under a classical corporate tax system.\\n40\\nThe second explanation is share repurchase constraints . In some countries there are reg-\\nulations that restrict share repurchases by firms. They were originally adopted to stop firmscreating speculative runs to inflate their share prices above fundamentals, but in recent timesthey have been used explicitly to stop firms from avoiding the higher taxes on dividends. Forexample, in the United States penalties are imposed on firms that systematically repurchaseinterest dividends capital gains\\n(1 )−> −ttBh\\nC (1 ) )( ) ( )( ) . 11 139−< −−∀tt t hBh\\nCEhVY\\nbi gi diBGD01\\n1=+++,Corporate finance 239', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 251}),\n",

Auerbach (1979), Bradford (1981) and King (1977)offered the new or trapped view of dividends where they argue share repurchase constraints\\nforce firms to pay dividends.\\nUnfortunately, though, this equilibrium outcome has an Achilles’ heel because it relies on\\nthe important assumption that firms cannot trade each other’ s shares. Inter-corporate equityis significant in practice, and it provides a substitute for share repurchases. To see this, con-sider a firm A with $100 of equity income. If it cannot repurchase $100 of its own shares topay capital gains it can buy $100 of firm B’ s shares, and firm B then uses the proceeds tobuy $100 of firm A’ s shares. In the absence of transactions costs or taxes on inter-corporateequity, firm A has replaced $100 of cash with $100 of equity in firm B which offsets thevalue of its own outstanding shares. The market value of firm B is unchanged by these tradesbecause the $100 liability from selling its own shares is matched by the value of shares itholds in firm A, while shareholders in firm A have 100 dollars of cash that offsets the lowervalue of equity they now hold in firm A. Thus, the $100 income generated by firm A hasbeen transferred to its shareholders as capital gains.\\nGovernments are less concerned now than they were in the past about firms trying to\\ninflate their share valuations through share repurchase activity because institutional tradershave more information about the identity of buyers and sellers and how much equity theytrade. In fact, brokers frequently share this information with each other to stop traders fromBox 7.16 The dividend puzzle\\nThe dividend puzzle is illustrated in the diagram below, where the asset possibility frontier\\nRCRCisolates the largest amount of equity firms can supply from their aggregate net cash flows\\nafter meeting their obligations to bondholders and paying corporate tax. Since capital gains anddividends are both subject to corporate tax it does not alter the slope of the asset frontier, whereboth types of equity must pay the same market return for firms to supply them, with i\\nD=iG.\\nBut personal taxes are lower on capital gains for all consumers, so their indifference schedulesare steeper than the asset possibility frontier where they require to tradeboth securities, with i\\nD>iG. That is why firms only pay capital gains at aˆG.

Bhattacharya (1979) and Miller and Rock (1985) identify circumstances where firm\\nmanagers use dividend payments to signal the quality of their expected net cash flows toshareholders with incomplete information. Higher taxes on dividends are signalling coststhat allow them to function as a credible signal in these circumstances. When dividend pay-ments are optimally chosen these costs are equated at the margin to the benefits sharehold-ers get from the information provided. Using financial data for 156 firms in the US over theperiod 1950–1997, Sarig (2004) finds empirical support for the signalling benefits of divi-\\ndends, where the benefits from changes in dividends were found to be larger than the ben-efits from changes in share repurchases, while an increase in profitability leads initially toan increase in share repurchases and then later an increase in dividends once there is con-firmation of the profitability being sustained in the long run. Rozeff (1982) and Easterbrook(1984) argue that dividends can be paid to reduce agency costs arising from managers con-\\nsuming perquisites and from managerial risk aversion . Since dividend payments reduce free\\ncash flows they limit managerial perquisites. They also force firms to go to the capitalBox 7.17 The dividend puzzle and trading costs\\nThe impact of trading costs on the choice between dividends and capital gains is illustrated in\\nthe diagram below. For trading costs ( T) to make dividends preferable they must be relatively\\nhigher for capital gains, where those incurred by consumers make their indifference schedulesflatter , and those by firms make the asset production frontier steeper . In effect,higher trading costs raise the relative cost of capital gains for firms and reduce their relativereturn to consumers.

In contrast, the pecking order theory of\\nMyers and Majluf (1984) finds a negative relationship between them. When potential share-holders have less information than existing shareholders about the profitability of new proj-ects they can discount share prices by more than the net present value of the profits. Sincethis makes existing shareholders worse off they reject these projects so that managers areforced to move down the pecking order and use internal funds and (risk-free) debt. Sincelower dividends create a larger pool of internal funds there is a negative relationship betweendividends and the level of asymmetric information. Using data for manufacturing firms thattraded on the NYSE and the AMEX over the five-year period 1988–1992, Deshmukh (2005)finds empirical support for the pecking order theory over the signalling theory.\\n7.3.3 Dividend imputation\\nIt is clear from the dividend puzzle examined in the previous section why a classical corpo-\\nrate tax distorts the financing decisions of firms. One way to eliminate the double tax onequity income is to eliminate the corporate tax altogether. But in its absence shareholdershave an incentive to delay realizing this income as capital gains so they can lower their effec-tive personal tax rates.\\n41In effect, their tax liabilities are delayed at no interest cost. The cor-\\nporate tax deters this activity by collecting revenue on equity income as it accrues insidefirms, but the double taxation is especially problematic for dividends.Box 7.18 The dividend puzzle and share repurchase constraints\\nWhen there are constraints on the security trades of firms that force them to pay equity income\\nas dividends, consumers are forced onto lower indifference schedules due to the extra taxburden.

Another important reason for keeping the corporate tax is to collect revenueon domestic income paid to foreign shareholders as personal taxes are normally levied onlyon the income of domestic residents.\\nOne important aspect of dividend imputation is the distinction it makes between franked\\n(F) and unfranked dividends ( U). Franked dividends are paid from income subject to corpo-\\nrate tax, while unfranked dividends are paid from untaxed income.

These costs cause their asset frontier R\\nFRFto kink downwards around\\nthe origin.

       " Document(page_content='8 Project evaluation and the \\nsocial discount rate\\nIn competitive economies without taxes and other market distortions, private and public\\nsector projects are evaluated in the same way (when distributional effects are not taken intoaccount). That is, their future net cash flows are discounted using the same marginal opportunity cost of time and risk. In reality, however, a number of market distortions anddistributional effects drive wedges between social marginal valuations and costs where different rules are used to evaluate private and public projects. Taxes and subsidies are themost familiar distortions, but others include externalities, non-competitive behaviour andthe private underprovision of public goods. In this chapter we evaluate public projects wherethe government provides a pure public good in a tax-distorted economy with aggregateuncertainty. The analysis is initially undertaken in a two-period setting with frictionlesscompetitive markets where consumers have common information and trade in a completecapital market.\\nThis chapter consists of two sections: the first isolates conditions for the optimal \\nprovision of a pure public good in each time period, while the second derives the social \\ndiscount rate for public projects in the presence of tax distortions. To make the analysis less\\ncomplicated we assume the public goods are only supplied by the government, which maximizes social welfare.\\n1One can think of the public good as national defence which, \\nby law, cannot be supplied by private traders in most countries. Initially we obtainSamuelson conditions for the optimal provision of the public goods ( G\\nt) in each time period\\n(t=0,1) without taxes and other distortions. This familiar condition equates the current \\nvalue of the summed marginal consumption benefits from a public good to thecurrent value of its marginal production cost ( MRT\\nt). When the consumption benefits \\nand resource costs from providing the public good in the second period are risky they are discounted using a stochastic discount factor which is the same for all consumers and firms.\\nIn the presence of taxes on market trades the optimality conditions for public goods\\nchange whenever resources are reallocated in distorted markets. We derive the Samuelsonconditions when the government raises revenue with lump-sum taxes, but in the presence ofdistorting trade taxes. There are additional welfare effects when the projects impact on activ-ity in tax-distorted markets. They can raise or lower welfare, and are not taken into accountby the private sector when evaluating projects. The analysis is then extended by derivingrevised Samuelson conditions when the government raises revenue with the distorting tradetaxes. Their marginal excess burden increases the marginal social cost of public funds andreduces the optimal supply of the public goods. In an intertemporal setting projects in oneperiod can affect economic activity in both periods, where additional welfare effects fromchanges in taxed activities affect the optimal supply of the public goods.()MRSGt', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 263}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='In Section 8.2 we derive the social discount rate in the presence of a tax on capital\\nincome. This measures the extra future consumption expenditure generated by savinganother dollar of capital in the first period. Since the income tax distorts intertemporal con-sumption choices the private discount rate deviates from the social discount rate. To makethe analysis less complex, and to focus on a number of key issues, we assume the tax rate isthe same for all consumers and applies to all capital income. In practice, consumers havedifferent marginal tax rates, and taxes differ across capital assets. For example, consumersin most countries face progressive marginal personal tax rates on income, with higher taxrates on cash distributions, such as dividends and interest, than on capital gains. Moreover,equity income is double-taxed under a classical corporate tax system, once at the corporaterate and then again at the personal tax rates of shareholders. While these are importantaspects of taxes in most countries, a much simpler tax system is adopted here to focus on the way income taxes in general impact on the social discount rate. This allows us to anticipate how the social discount rate will change under more realistic tax systems.\\nThere has been considerable controversy over what discount rate to use when evaluating\\npublic projects in the presence of income taxes and risk. In a two-period certainty setting,Harberger (1969) and Sandmo and Drèze (1971) find the social discount rate is a weightedaverage of the borrowing and lending rates of interest in the presence of a uniform incometax. By including additional time periods, Marglin (1963a,1963b) finds it should be higherthan the weighted average formula, while Bradford (1975) finds it should be approximatelyequal to the after-tax interest rate paid to savers. Sjaastad and Wisecarver (1977) show howthese differences are explained by the treatment of capital depreciation. In a common infor-mation setting where private saving rises to replace depreciation of public capital the discount rate becomes the weighted average formula in a multi-period setting. Marglin\\nassumes there is no adjustment in private saving so that depreciation allowances are con-sumed, while Bradford adopts a Keynesian consumption function which makes saving aconstant fraction of aggregate income, thereby precluding endogenous changes in privatesaving to offset depreciation in public capital. Since optimizing agents make consumptionchoices in each time period based on their wealth, a Keynesian consumption function seemsunsuitable. Private wealth depends on the expected benefits generated by publicly providedgoods and services and the taxes levied to fund them. However, it seems unlikely in practicethat consumers correctly compute the expected depreciation on every item of public capital,where the discount rate will exceed the weighted average formula.\\nSamuelson (1964), Vickery (1964) and Arrow and Lind (1970) argue the social discount\\nrate should be lower on public sector projects because the government can raise funds atlower risk. They claim the public sector can eliminate diversifiable risk and spread aggre-gate uncertainty at lower cost than the private sector. Bailey and Jensen (1972) argue theseclaims are implicitly based on distortions in private risk markets which the public sector canovercome more effectively. They contend, however, that the reverse is much more likely inpractice. That is, private markets are likely to provide the same or better opportunities fortrading risk, and at lower cost, as private traders are specialists facing better incentives thanthe public sector.\\nThe analysis commences in Section 8.1 using a two-period model of a tax-\\ndistorted economy with aggregate uncertainty. A conventional welfare equation is obtainedfor changes in the provision of the pure public goods and distorting trade taxes in each timeperiod. The Samuelson conditions for these goods are obtained under different fundingarrangements to examine the role of tax distortions and risk on optimal policy choices.

A large literature looks at deriving them as functions of non-comparableordinal utility functions assigned to consumers.

In particular, theyare path-dependent, which means welfare measures can be manipulated by reordering agiven set of policy changes. This problem is overcome by measuring compensated welfarechanges. They isolate the impact of policy changes on the government budget when lump-sum transfers are made to hold constant the utility of every consumer. If a policy changegenerates surplus revenue (at constant utility) it can be used by the government to raise theutility of every consumer, while the reverse applies when it drives the budget into deficit.Thus, compensated welfare changes are changes in real income that get converted into util-ity when the government balances its budget. How these changes in real income are distrib-uted across consumers depends, in part, on endogenous price changes and also on the taxchanges the government makes to balance its budget.\\n22\\nWe measure compensated welfare changes for the projects examined in the previous \\nsection by including foreign aid payments ( Rmeasured in units of domestic currency) in the\\nfirst-period government budget constraint in (8.4), with T0=MRT0G0−L0+R, where the \\nconventional welfare equation in (8.7) becomes\\n(8.7′)\\nEndogenous changes in Risolate surplus government revenue from the policy changes when\\nexpected utility is held constant at its initial level, with dW=0, where the compensated wel-\\nfare equation is obtained from (8.7 ′) as\\n(8.16)\\nWelfare gains are surplus revenue the government could pay as foreign aid , while\\nwelfare losses are gifts of foreign aid it would need to receive at unchanged domesticutility.\\n24Thus, they isolate the changes in real income from policy changes.

They redistribute income across con-sumers as well as across states of nature. In this subsection we relate compensated welfarechanges to actual dollar changes in expected utility.

It isolates the change in real income (that thegovernment could pay as foreign aid at no cost to domestic utility) when the expected CVis used to hold constant the utility of every consumer in both time periods and in everystate. Thus, it measures the extra real income for the true status quo. Once this surplus rev-enue is distributed through lump-sum transfers back to domestic consumers the incomeeffects raise their expected utility by the welfare change ( dW/dG\\n1) in (8.11). This relation-\\nship can be formalized as a generalized version of the Hatta (1977) decomposition by writ-ing the social welfare function used in (8.6) over the exogenous policy variables G\\n0, G1, t0,\\nt1, and R, as W(G0, G1, t0, t1, R) where the change in foreign aid payments that would offset\\nthe welfare effects from marginally raising output of the public good in the second periodsolves\\n(8.22)\\nWe obtain the generalized Hatta decomposition for the project by rearranging these terms, as\\n(8.23)\\nwhere S\\nR=– dW/dR =1 – dT/dRis the shadow value of government revenue ; it measures the\\namount social welfare rises when a dollar of surplus revenue is endowed on the governmentwho transfers it to domestic consumers to balance its budget.

Some argue it should be the same discount rate used by pr ivate operators, while\\nothers claim it should be lower. In economies with distorted markets due to taxes, external-ities and non-competitive behaviour, the social discount rate will, in general, be different from the discount rate used by private investors for the same project. In particular,income taxes drive wedges between the cost of capital for investors and the after-tax returnsto savers. Harberger (1969) and Sandmo and Drèze (1971) show how this makes the socialdiscount rate a weighted average of the borrowing and lending rates of interest in a two-period certainty setting. By extending their analysis to additional time periods Marglin(1963a, 1963b) finds it is higher than the weighted average formula, while Bradford (1975)finds it is approximately equal to the after-tax interest rate. Sjaastad and Wisecarver (1977)show how these differences are explained by the treatment of depreciation in public capital.Whenever private saving adjusts to replace this depreciation the weighted average formulaalso applies in a multi-period setting.\\nOthers claim the discount rate for public projects is affected by risk. Samuelson\\n(1964), Vickery (1964) and Arrow and Lind (1970) claim it should be lower than the dis-count rate used by private firms undertaking the same project. Samuelson and Vickeryargue this  happens because the public sector undertakes many projects with uncorre-lated returns that allow them to eliminate diversifiable risk. Arrow and Lind take a dif-ferent approach by arguing the public sector can use the tax system to spread risk over alarge number of consumers when project returns are uncorrelated with aggregateincome. Essentially, both arguments rely on the government being able to eliminatediversifiable risk and trade aggregate uncertainty at lower cost than private markets.Bailey and Jensen (1972) claim this is not, in general, the case, where the risk premiumin the discount rate should be the same for the public and private sector when undertak-ing the same projects.\\nIn this section we derive the weighted average formula of Harberger, and of Sandmo and\\nDrèze, before extending their analysis to accommodate uncertainty. Then we consider thesocial discount rates obtained by Marglin and Bradford when there are more than two timeperiods, and reconcile them with weighted average formula using the analysis in Sjaastadand Wisecarver. This allows us to isolate the important role of depreciation in public capital.Finally, we examine the arguments by Samuelson, Vickery, and Arrow and Lind that discount rates for public projects should be lower.(ˆ/)dR dG10>', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 281}),\n",

For example, a con-sumption tax drives a wedge between marginal consumption benefits and marginalproduction costs, where consumer prices overstate social costs and producer prices under-state social benefits. With downward-sloping demand schedules and increasing marginalcost schedules the true (social) value of any good is a weighted average of its consumer andproducer prices. This same logic applies to the discount rate that determines the opportunitycost of current consumption.

When evaluating public projects we use a social dis-count rate that captures the full social opportunity cost of capital, including a risk premiumwhen the net cash flows impose costs on risk-averse consumers. We extend the analysis inthe previous section by including aggregate uncertainty in the presence of the uniformincome tax (and without trade taxes), where, from (8.25), the social discount rate becomesthe state-contingent weighted average formula,\\n(8.27)\\nIn this setting there is a risk premium in the return to capital, and it is computed in the same\\nway for private and public sector projects when the government has no advantage over theprivate sector in trading risk.\\nWe can see from the general expression for the social discount rate in (8.25) that it can\\ndeviate from the weighted average formula when there are other market distortions – in thiscase, trade taxes. By using the capital market clearing condition, we have\\n(8.28)\\nwhere the last two terms are welfare effects from resource movements in distorted markets.\\nWhen private saving falls, it reduces the net supply of the private good and exacerbates theexcess burden of the trade tax, where the reduction in trade tax revenue in the second lastterm is a welfare loss. In contrast, the additional tax revenue in the last term is a welfare gainfrom reducing the excess burden of the trade tax in the first period. Whether these additionalwelfare changes move the social discount rate above or below the weighted average formuladepends on the change in net demand for the private good in the second period. If it generatesa welfare gain (in the last term) that is large enough to offset the welfare loss from the reduc-tion in current trade tax revenue (in the second last term) the social discount rate rises abovethe weighted average formula. Once trade tax revenue declines in present value terms, the dis-count rate falls below the weighted average formula. Ultimately, the final outcome dependsupon the size of the taxes as well as consumer preferences and production technologies.\\nThese related market effects are often overlooked in the evaluation of small-scale project\\nevaluation because they are too costly to measure. Typically project outputs and inputs havecross-effects in a number of distorted markets, and they can be isolated using a general equilibrium model with parameter values calibrated on data taken from the economy.Alternatively, they can be estimated directly from data using empirical analysis. But theseoptions are often too costly to undertake, where the distortions on project outputs and inputsare the only ones taken into account. Goulder and Williams (2003) find income taxes on capital and labour inputs have the most important welfare effects. Indeed, they oftendominate the welfare effects arising from taxes and other distortions on project outputs.Thus, for small-scale projects it would seem prudent to include welfare effects arising fromdistortions on project outputs and inputs, and to ignore welfare effects from indirect cross-effects in other distorted markets.ψα α τ α τss s s iit\\npit=+ − − − − +− + () ( ) () [( ) ]11 1 1 10\\n01\\nppx\\nxss\\n00∂\\n∂∀,ψα α τss s ii s=+ − − ∀ () ( ) .11', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 286}),\n",

We could also include distributional effects byassigning different distributional weights to consumers in the welfare change in (8.6). A number of these extensions are examined in Jones (2005) where social discount rates arepersonalized for consumers facing different taxes on income and different distributionalweights. While these extensions make the social discount rate more accurate, they make theanalysis more complex without adding greatly to the insights already obtained earlier.Instead, we extend the analysis in the next section by adding more time periods to examinethe impact of capital depreciation on the social discount rate.\\n8.2.2 Multiple time periods and capital depreciation\\nIn a two-period setting depreciation plays no role in the analysis because all capital is liqui-\\ndated in the second period. With extra time periods capital can be carried beyond the secondperiod, where (economic) depreciation measures the change in the market value of the assetin each year of its life. Unless investment rises to replace depreciated capital, future con-sumption will fall. Marglin (1963a, 1963b) and Bradford (1975) find the social discount ratedeviates from the weighted average formula when they add time periods to the analysis ofHarberger, and Sandmo and Drèze. Sjaastad and Wisecarver (1977) show that this occursbecause depreciation is not matched by additional private saving. Using certainty analysiswith an infinite time horizon, Marglin finds the discount rate is higher than the weightedaverage formula in (8.26). This is demonstrated for a public project that generates a payoutof 1 +δin the second period of its life and none thereafter. It is socially profitable when\\n(8.29)\\nThis condition makes the present value of the net consumption flow greater than or equal to\\nits social cost. Since this project increases the demand for capital in the economy it is satisfied through a rise in private saving and/or a reduction in private investment, whereMarglin identifies the social cost of forgone current consumption due to the increase in private saving as 1 −α, and the present value of forgone future consumption ( αi) in perpe-\\ntuity due to the increase in private investment as αi/[i(1 −τ)]. Rearranging (8.29), we find\\nthe project is socially profitable when\\n(8.30)\\nUsing a Keynesian consumption function that makes saving a constant fraction of income\\nin each time period, Bradford finds the same project is socially profitable when\\n(8.31)\\nwhich implies .\\nThese findings by Marglin and Bradford create a dilemma for policy analysts, as they\\nsuggest the social discount rate can range in value from i(1 − τ) to something above the\\nδτ ψ/asymptequali()1−<1\\n111+\\n+−δ\\nτ i(),/asymptequalδψ α τ ψ≥+ > i .1\\n1111+\\n+−≥− +−δ\\nταα\\nτ ii\\ni ()()().', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 287}),\n",

Once consumers adjust their saving to replace this depreciation, the weighted average formula applies in a multi-period setting. They demonstrate this for the project considered by Marglin, where the payout in the secondperiod becomes\\nwith 1 +δbeing the direct consumption benefit from the project, αthe fall in current consump-\\ntion when saving rises to offset the depreciation in public capital, and αithe fall in consump-\\ntion due to the reduction in private investment.

As wealth-maximizing agents they compute the expected con-sumption benefits from public capital and the higher expected taxes to replace depreciated capital. If, for what ever reason, consumers do not adjust their saving to offset depreciation in public capital the social discount rate rises above the weighted average formula.\\n8.2.3 Market frictions and risk\\nA number of studies argue the social discount rate can be lower for public projects when the\\ngovernment can trade risk at lower cost than trades in private markets. Samuelson (1964)and Vickery (1964) argue the government is a relatively large investor in the economy thatundertakes many projects with uncorrelated risks that can be diversified inside the publicsector. As a consequence, it can pool these risks at lower cost than the private sector bybundling securities in portfolios and purchasing insurance. Arrow and Lind (1970) argue thediscount rates on public projects are lower because their returns are uncorrelated with aggregate income and the government can diversify risk across a large number of consumersthrough the tax system. Thus, the public sector offers better opportunities for trading aggregate risk and eliminating diversifiable risk.\\nBailey and Jensen (1972) refute both these claims by arguing consumers can achieve the\\nsame, if not better, risk-trading opportunities in private markets. Indeed, the absence of a profit motive can make public employees less efficient operators, thereby raising the costsof trading risk. And since most taxes distort activity, the tax system is likely to be a morecostly way of spreading risk across consumers.\\n33Bailey and Jensen also argue public \\nproject returns are mostly correlated with aggregate income, which means they containaggregate risk that cannot be diversified inside the public sector.

These problems, which were examined in Chapter 5, can raise thecost of eliminating diversifiable risk. If it can be eliminated at lower cost through the taxsystem, or by pooling it inside the public sector, the discount rate on public projects will belower. However, as Dixit (1987, 1989) observes, the public sector is also subject to the sameinformation asymmetries as private traders, and it may not be able to lower the cost of trad-ing risk. For that reason it is important to examine the risk-spreading opportunities availableto the public sector when it too is subject to moral hazard and adverse selections problems.In the final analysis, a lower discount rate for public projects must be based on some formof market friction (or failure) which the government is able to overcome at lower cost thanthe private sector, and these cost efficiencies need to be quantified to determine their impacton the discount rate.\\nProblems\\n1The government collects revenue from a consumption tax on cigarettes ( C) when the\\naggregate demand function (measured in thousands of cartons) is\\nwhere q=p+tis the consumer price per carton (measured in dollars), with pbeing the \\nproducer price and t=5 the constant tax per carton.\\ni Use a partial equilibrium analysis to compute the marginal social cost of public\\nfunds (MCF) for the consumption tax on cigarettes when they are produced at a constant marginal cost of $6 per carton (with no fixed costs).

       " Document(page_content='Notes\\n1 Introduction\\n1 It is difficult to isolate purely atemporal trades as most goods embody future consumption. \\nFor example, packets of washing powder and breakfast cereals have consumption flows in thefuture and are, strictly speaking, capital assets. Financial securities have a limited role in facilitat-ing purely atemporal trades in a certainty setting where the quality and quantity of the goods areknown to buyers and sellers. Once we introduce time and asymmetric information, financial secu-rities can be used to specify the obligations on both parties to get or provide the necessary infor-mation about the product being exchanged.\\n2 Governments are monopoly suppliers of currency (notes and coins), but the money supply is more\\nbroadly defined to include cheque and other deposit account balances used for trading goods andservices. Since financial institutions keep a fraction of their deposits as currency to meet the cashdemands of depositors, there is a multiplier effect from changes in the supply of currency. The nomi-nal price level equates supply and demand in the market for broadly defined money.\\n3 This is an important issue for the equilibrium asset pricing models examined in Chapter 4.4 The terms ‘risk’ and ‘uncertainty’ are frequently treated as the same thing. Knight (1921) defined\\nrisk as uncertain outcomes over which individuals assign probabilities, while uncertainty relates tooutcomes over which they do not, or cannot, assign such probabilities. But this distinction is less clearwhen consumers with different information assign subjective probabilities to uncertain outcomes.\\n5 Futures contracts are standardized forward contracts which trade on formal futures exchanges,\\nwhereas forward contracts also include tailor made agreements between buyers and sellers thattrade over the counter.\\n6 We use the conventional analysis recommended by Harberger where aggregate welfare is the sum\\nof the dollar changes in expected utility for consumers. In effect, this approach uses a Bergson–Samuelson individualistic social welfare function (Bergson 1938; Samuelson 1954) and ignores any distributional effects by assigning the same distributional weight of unity to all consumers.Distributional effects can be included in the analysis by assigning different weights to consumers.\\n7 Initially both schemes were adopted to reduce the variability in producer prices, but they eventu-\\nally became price support schemes for domestic producers. Both schemes were eventually aban-doned due to the very large costs they imposed on taxpayers.\\n2 Investment decisions under certainty\\n1 Capital goods are stocks of future consumption, while investment is the flow of resources into \\ncapital goods over a specified period of time.\\n2 Strictly speaking, the capital market is where all intertemporal trade takes place. It includes trades\\nin physical commodities, such as apples, or financial securities which provide income streams infuture periods. There are sub-markets in the capital market, including the financial market wherefinancial securities trade, and the real estate market where property trades. A number of other markets are included in the financial market, such as banks, the stock market, the futuresexchange, the bond market, and the markets for derivative securities (options, swaps, warrants,etc). In finance it is not uncommon for the financial market to be referred to by default as the cap-ital market, where this reflects a focus on trades in financial securities.', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 292}),\n",

When each consumer hhas a weak preference relation over these bundles\\nthat is complete, transitive, and continuous, they can be represented by a utility function,\\nsuch that\\nA proof of the existence of the utility function can be found in most graduate microeconomics \\ntextbooks; see, for example, Mas-Colell et al. (1995). This function is a contemporaneous meas-\\nure of utility where each consumer chooses their intertemporal consumption in the first period.Thus, they measure utility from future consumption in the first period.\\n4 These constraints require each element in the set of consumption goods to be less than or equal to\\nits corresponding element in the set of endowments in each time period.\\n5 For standard preferences we assume the utility function u\\nhis monotone (to rule out satiation), \\nand strictly quasi-concave (to make the indifference schedules strictly convex to the origin in thecommodity space). They are adopted by default in the following analysis.\\n6 We obtain this marginal rate of substitution by totally differentiating the utility function, with:\\ndu =u\\n0′(n)dx0(n)+u1′(n) dx1(n)=0.\\nAfter rearranging terms, we have\\nwhere MRS1,0 (n)∫−dx0(n)/dx1(n) is the inverse of the slope of the indifference curve at the \\nendowment point in Figure 2.1.

In other words, their indifference schedules in Figure 2.1 have thesame slope along a 45 ∞line through the origin.\\n8 It should be noted that this also accommodates storage when it is the most efficient way of trans-\\nferring consumption goods to future time periods. After all, production is a process that convertsresources into more valuable goods and services, where in a certainty setting they are distin-guished from each other by their physical characteristics, geographic location and location in time.\\n9 This derivation of the marginal rate of substitution uses the fact that ∂z\\n0(n)/∂x0(n) =−1.\\n10 Malinvaud (1972) distinguishes between discount rates for income and discount rates for future con-\\nsumption goods.

We introduce financial securities in Section 2.2.3 and show how they allow consumers tochoose their distribution of income over time (subject to the constraint that income sums to theirwealth in present value terms). In fact, income can be used as a representative commodity in aneconomy without financial securities if consumers can trade intertemporally using forward contracts. What financial securities do is reduce the number of variables that consumers mustdetermine in the first period, where they choose the value and composition of their consumptionbundle and their holding of financial securities. While they decide the composition of future consumption in the first period, the choices are actually made in the second period. However, inexchange economies with forward contracts, consumers must determine the value and composi-tion of their current and future consumption bundles in the first period.MRS nh\\n1011, / [ ( )].≡+ ρhλλ10 11hh h i // ( )≡+dx n\\ndx nun\\nundu0\\n1 01\\n0()\\n()()\\n(),\\n==−′\\n′xx xx u xx u xhA hA h hB hB h hA hA h\\n01 01 01,, ,{} −{} ⇔( )≥ /H11373001hB hBx,.( )uhN:,/Rbb/Rbb2→+≻hNotes 281', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 293}),\n",

The endowments of goods in every time period can change over time, and\\nit is relatively straightforward to include additional time periods in a certainty setting because allthe equilibrium prices in the future are known in the first period by every agent. Consumers get util-ity from consumption expenditure in time periods out to infinity when they care about their heirs,but a lower bound has to be placed on their wealth to stop them from creating unbounded liabilitiesby continually borrowing to delay loan repayments until the infinite future where they have zerocurrent value. While the interest rate and commodity prices can change over time in a certainty set-ting, they are known in advance by all consumers who use common discount factors on future netcash flows when they trade in frictionless competitive markets. That is not the case, however, whenthere is uncertainty unless agents have common information. Uncertainty is examined in the nextchapter.\\n37 Using (2.12) we can write the share of profit for each consumer as , where\\nthe budget constraint in each time period becomes:\\n38 The long-term interest rate for period Tis the geometric mean of the short rates in each period \\nt-1 to t, with\\n39 Frequently they are extracted earlier than this due to activity rules governments impose on titles\\ngranted for exploration and mining.\\n40 Since the annual interest rate is the geometric mean of a sequence of short rates over the year the\\n100-day rate solves:\\n41 This valuation assumes the expectations hypothesis holds.\\n42 When bondholders face this risk and information is costly the shareholders may favour more risky\\nprojects, where bondholders respond by discounting bond prices.

In prior time periods before the uncertainty is resolved there are possible eventswhich are subsets of the set of true states of the world. In the first time period there is a single event that includes all possible states, while in the final time period there are as many events asthere are states of the world. When there are more than two time periods there are fewer states ineach event as time passes because some of the uncertainty is resolved. We provide a more com-plete description of the state space in Section 3.1. In the following analysis we use a two-periodmodel where each event in the second period coincides with one of the states of nature.

The analysis is much more complicated when consumers have different information and form different expectations aboutfuture equilibrium outcomes, which is the case when information is costly to acquire. Solving anequilibrium outcome for the economy in these circumstances requires that these costs be specified,as well as the technologies consumers use to acquire information. For example, they may take information from the initial market prices of contingent commodity contracts because they pro-vide signals of what the market is expecting commodity prices to be in the future.\\n4 The economics of insurance is examined separately in Chapter 5.5 Policy evaluation is examined in Chapter 8.6 This closely follows the presentation provided in Lengwiler (2004).7 A partition divides the full set of states into pairwise disjoint non-empty subsets. Thus, the state\\nspace is the sum of these subsets. As time passes the partitions become finer. That is, there arefewer and fewer states in each event, until in the final period there as many events as states ofnature.\\n8 Ehrlich and Becker (1972) argue that assumption (iii) rules out self-protection by consumers to\\nreduce the probability of bad outcomes. But we accommodate this activity by adding individualrisk to the aggregate (state) uncertainty. In particular, we expand the possible outcomes in eachstate by including risk that is diversifiable across the population. For example, a portion of thepopulation will suffer losses from car accidents, but they can self-protect and reduce the probabil-ity of accidents by driving more slowly and at safer times. Moral hazard arises when this effort to self-protect cannot be costlessly observed by insurers, where consumers have less incentive to self-protect if they are not directly rewarded with lower insurance premiums for their marginal effort.Individual risk expands the outcome space, but without affecting the state probabilities. The prob-ability of each final outcome is the sum of the state probability plus the probability of incurringlosses in that state. When individual risk can be costlessly eliminated through insurance, it is eliminated from the consumption expenditure of individual consumers.\\n9 It is implicitly assumed in the following discussion that consumers with more information have \\nsubjective probabilities that are closer to the ‘true’ underlying objective probabilities; these arethe probabilities that would prevail with complete information. Moreover, consumers with thesame information have the same beliefs, which is the Harsanyi doctrine. But this may not alwaysapply in reality because consumers can have different technologies for converting informationinto beliefs, so that two consumers with the same information may form different beliefs. Indeed,they may have different computational skills and different inherent abilities to process informa-tion. When we characterize a competitive equilibrium in the following analysis consumers areassumed to have common beliefs so that they agree on the event-contingent prices for goods infuture time periods. Allowing them to have different information and beliefs is problematicbecause we need to specify the way information is collected and processed and at what costbefore we can solve the equilibrium outcome. For example, market prices may provide informa-tion to consumers that will change their beliefs, and this in turn will impact on prices throughtheir trades.\\n10 When consumers hold different beliefs about the state-contingent commodity prices, due to\\nincomplete and asymmetric information, the equilibrium outcomes are a function of theirinformation sets. This creates problems when consumers obtain information from endoge-nously determined variables such as market prices when forming their beliefs. Radner (1972) considers the role of information and consumer beliefs on equilibrium outcomes underuncertainty.\\n11 Consumer preference rankings can be described by this generalized utility function when they are\\ncomplete, continuous and transitive. In the following analysis we also assume they are monotonic,to rule out satiation, and strictly quasi-concave, to make the indifference curves strictly convex tothe origin in the commodity space. These preferences do not separate the probabilities and utilityderived from consumption in each state. This is examined in Section 3.2 where we derive the vonNeumann–Morgenstern expected utility function.\\n12 We follow the practice adopted in the previous chapter and make good 1 numeraire when there \\nis no fiat currency in the economy. One could easily refer to a unit of good 1 as a dollar and thencontinue to define values in dollar terms.

DeAngelo\\nand Masulis (1980a, 1980b) exploit this property of a complete capital market when they exam-ine the effects of firm financial policy by working directly with primitive securities.\\n21 We examine the Miller (1977) equilibrium in Chapter 7 where consumers with progressive per-\\nsonal income taxes have different tax preferences for securities that allow them to increase theirwealth through tax arbitrage. This activity continues until they eliminate their tax preferences orhave  borrowing constraints imposed on them.\\n22 A unique equilibrium will exist in the absence of taxes when consumers have strictly convex\\nindifference sets and firms have strictly convex production possibility sets. The indifferencesets are mappings from ordinal utility functions that are complete, transitive, reflexive, contin-uous and strictly quasi-concave, while the production possibility sets are mappings from strictlyconcave  production functions with no fixed costs. A unique equilibrium will exist under moregeneral circumstances, where a proof of the existence of equilibrium in the Arrow–Debreueconomy is  provided by Mas-Colell et al. (1995). Multiple equilibrium outcomes cannot be\\nruled out by adopting these standard assumptions on preferences and production technologiesin economies with taxes and other price distortions. This is demonstrated by Foster andSonnenschein (1970).\\n23 These possibilities are examined in Chambers and Quiggin (2000).24 The utility functional U(·) is a cardinal preference mapping over consumption expenditure.\\n25 For a discussion of these difficulties, see Grant and Karni (2004) and Karni (1993).26 Anscombe and Aumann (1963) make the distinction between roulette-wheel lotteries and horse-\\nrace lotteries so that they can identify the subjective probabilities consumers assign to states whenthey have state-independent preferences. It allows them to separate randomness in income withineach state and between states.\\n27 If we adopt the common prior assumption, which is referred to as the Harsanyi doctrine , con-\\nsumers with the same information have the same probability beliefs. But Kreps (1990) argues thatsince we allow consumers to have different preferences over the same consumption bundles weshould also allow them to form different probability beliefs from the same information.\\n28 The expected utility function can be used to rank preferences over state-contingent outcomes if we\\nextend the independence axiom. Savage does this by adopting the sure-thing principle so that rankings of outcomes depend only on states where they differ. There are also additional axioms to describe the way consumers form their probability beliefs. Ultimately the aim is for consumersto have subjective probabilities that they believe could be the true objective probabilities.

In this book it is referred to as the CBPM, while the term CCAPM is used inChapter 4 to refer to the consumption-beta CAPM derived by Breeden and Litzenberger (1978)and Breeden (1979) where the beta coefficient is the covariance between the expected return on any\\nsecurity kand the growth in aggregate consumption divided by the variance in aggregate consump-\\ntion.

When consumers purchase insurance\\nthey create a mutual fund that makes payments to those who incur losses. A common example iscar insurance, where drivers face a positive probability of having an accident that can impact ontheir consumption. By purchasing insurance they reduce this consumption risk and spread the costof car accidents over all car insurers. However, problems can arise when there is asymmetric infor-mation between traders in the insurance market – in particular, when insurers cannot observe effortby consumers to change their probability or size of loss, or when they cannot distinguish betweenconsumers with different risk.

But this also means they view consumption in different time periods as highly complemen-tary and require a higher equilibrium interest rate to get them to save in a growing economy. Indeed, the interest rate is higher than what is observed in the data.

Thus, even if the Fisher effect holds, the real inter-est rate on these bonds will change with unanticipated inflation.\\n8 At the margin all investors must be equally risk-averse along a linear efficient frontier as their\\nindifference curves have the same slope.

We obtain (4.22) by noting that \\n10 Market risk is priced uniquely in the APT when the residuals are eliminated from the returns to\\nthe mimicking portfolios constructed to price factor risk. When this happens it becomes an exactfactor analysis. We demonstrate this in Section 4.3.3 when deriving the APT pricing equation fromthe CBPM in (3.17).\\n11 The no arbitrage condition was defined earlier in Theorem 3.1.12 Using vector notation we can write (4.23) as a\\nA[1] =0, where aAis the (1 × K) vector of security\\nweights in the arbitrage portfolio and [1] the ( K × 1) unit vector. As a risk-free portfolio we must\\nhave aAβ=[0] and aAε=[0], where βis the ( K × G) matrix of beta coefficients, [0] the (1 × G)\\nvector of zeros and εthe (K × 1) vector of residuals, which leads to with the ( K × 1)\\nvector of expected security returns. Since aAis orthogonal to the vector [1] and the columns in\\nmatrix β, which imply it is also orthogonal to the vector of security returns there is a linear rela-\\ntionship between these vectors, with\\nwhere λFand λβare, respectively, the ( K×1) and ( G×1) vectors of non-zero constants.\\nA crucial feature of this model is the zero price for residuals in the mimicking portfolio returns,\\nand the no arbitrage condition.

However, Fama (1998) shows that investor portfolios are in factmulti-factor minimum-variance efficient, where consumers combine the market portfolio with arisk-free security and mimicking portfolios to hedge against the factor risk. The return on eachmimicking portfolio is perfectly correlated with a state variable and uncorrelated with the returnon the market portfolio and all other state variables. Thus, the risk premium in mimicking portfo-lio returns are compensation paid to investors for bearing non-diversifiable risk described by theirstate variables.\\n24 Merton argues that if all traded securities by some quirk of nature are uncorrelated with the inter-\\nest rate, the term structure of interest rates for a riskless long-term bond will not satisfy the expec-tations hypothesis. This is based on the observation that consumers will pay a premium for aman-made security such as a long-term bond that is perfectly negatively correlated with changesin the interest rate, and hence by assumption that is not correlated with any other asset. But thispremium would be eliminated by arbitrage in a frictionless competitive capital market.\\n25 Since (4.22) is constructed as a regression equation the factor deviations, which have zero mean\\nvalues , are uncorrelated with each other and theresiduals have zero mean ( E(ε˜\\nk, ε˜j) = 0 for all k, j.

Some capital expenditure is included at the time of purchase, but it should instead be theconsumption flows generated over time. There are non-marketed consumption flows, like leisureand home-produced consumption, that are not included in reported data. Most countries makeadjustments to include major items such as the rental value of housing services consumed by owner-occupiers. Empirical tests of the CCAPM use a consumer price index to obtain a real measure ofconsumption expenditure. We summarize the results for some of these tests later in Section 4.5.\\n33 While consumption in each time period is related indirectly through wealth, which is the dis-\\ncounted present value of future income that can be transferred between periods by trading in thecapital market, the utility derived in each time period is independent of consumption expenditurein all other periods.\\n34 Optimally chosen future consumption expenditure can be summarized using means and variances\\nbecause consumers have state-independent preferences. This means they care only about the statistical distribution of their consumption expenditure. The mean–variance analysis then followsfrom assumptions when security returns are completely described by their means and variances.

Moreover, the tax system is not a costless way of diversifying idiosyncratic risk.

Their preferences can be summarized using NMEU functions with common information where they agree on the probabilities of all the possible outcomes, both for states andindividual risk. But with asymmetric information subjective expected utility is more appropriatewhen consumers have different probabilities beliefs, which takes the analysis outside the classicalfinance model used to generate the consumption-based pricing model in (4.28) where consumersmeasure and price risk identically.\\n3 A state-independent utility function may not be appropriate for some applications, such as health \\ninsurance, where preference mappings depend on the consumers’ well-being.\\n4 While we refer to these outcomes as good and bad states, they are not the states of nature defined\\nearlier in Section 3.1.1 that are common to all consumers and outside their control. In contrast, thegood and bad outcomes considered here are incurred by different individuals at the same time.Later we allow consumers to change the probability of bad state outcomes through self-protection.\\n5 There is a competitive equilibrium outcome for a single insurer when the market is perfectly \\ncontestable.

Ex-post observa-\\ntion occurs when consumers make claims, while ex-ante observation occurs at the time the poli-cies are written. Ex-ante observation is preferable if it is less costly than ex-post observation by anamount sufficient to offset the extra frequency of observation involved.\\n8 A considerable amount of work has been undertaken in this area looking at the adjustment\\nprocesses to equilibrium and the existence properties of these equilibria. See Greenwald and Stiglitz(1986), Harris and Townsend (1985), Riley (1975), Stiglitz (1981, 1982) and Wilson (1977).\\n9 It is assumed throughout the analysis that insurance is exclusive , so that consumers buy all their\\ninsurance from one insurer. It can also be interpreted as meaning that all insurers know how muchinsurance every consumer buys and stops them from taking more than full insurance.

Exclusivity stops high-risktypes from locating to the right of Lalong the low-risk price line.\\n6 Derivative securities\\n1 Most retail outlets provide consumers with a two-week cooling-off period when they purchase\\nmajor items.

To avoid any confusion we will refer to firmsas being short in a security when they purchase it and long when they sell it. This is consistent withthe notion that consumers are in general net buyers and firms net sellers of securities. There are anumber of reasons why firms may purchase securities. For tax reasons they repurchase their ownshares and the shares of other firms to pay shareholders capital gains rather than cash dividends,and they also purchase securities to spread risk and arbitrage profits. These activities will be examined in the following subsections.\\n6 We omit the time subscripts and superscript jto simplify the notation.\\n7 This decomposition is obtained by writing the user cost of capital as , where\\n8 We have , where .\\n9 These conditions are obtained from the problem for each firm in (2.12) by replacing their payout\\nconstraint, with superscript jomitted, as\\nbV\\n0(1+iB)( 1−tC)+(1−b)V0(1−tC+iE)≤Y1(Z0)( 1−tC).\\nBy rearranging this expression when the constraint binds we find that the corporate tax base is\\n(1−b)iEV0=(Y1(Z0)−biBV0−V0)( 1−tc).\\nSince the repayment of capital to debt and equity and interest are tax-deductible expenses the tax\\nfalls on the return paid to equity. We follow the usual (often implicit) convention adopted in mostfinance models by returning tax revenue to consumers as lump-sum transfers. This avoids the need to explicitly model government spending. But even though the tax revenue is returned to consumers, their real income falls due to the excess burden of taxation.\\n10 In reality, however, the corporate tax is levied on measured income which is not in general the\\nsame as economic income. Recall from Chapter 2 that economic income measures the change inthe wealth of consumers over a period of time. Thus, it includes capital gains (or losses) on their capital assets. In contrast, measured income applies decay factors to the purchase prices of depreciating assets as a proxy measure for the reduction in their market values, and only includescapital gains when they are realized. Whenever there are differences in economic and measuredincome the effective corporate tax rate on economic income diverges from the statutory tax rate.For example, when measured income is higher the effective tax rate on economic income risesabove the statutory corporate tax rate. We avoid this complexity in the following analysis byassuming economic and measured income are equal.\\n11 This assumes investors do not take into account any future consumption benefits they might get\\nfrom government spending funded from corporate tax revenue. In practice, individual investors donot directly link the tax they pay to the benefits they get from government spending.

But this is frequently inconsistent with other objectives they have to minimize theexcess burden of taxation. There is no doubt that part of the reason for the favourable tax treatmentof capital gains is the political influence of corporate firms. They make large contributions to political parties, while the costs are diffused over consumers with much less political influence.\\n20 The reduction in the effective personal tax rate from delaying the realization of capital gains \\ncan be demonstrated by comparing the after-tax return to a consumer from realizing a dollar of income today and then reinvesting it for one period with the after-tax return from leaving the income inside the firm for a year (1 +i\\nE)(1−th\\nB).

Canada and the United Kingdom adopted a partial imputation system. In the UK it wasreplaced in 1999 by a system that provided personal tax reductions on dividend income subject tocorporate tax. These personal tax concessions range from 100 per cent for basic-rate taxpayers to25 per cent for high-rate taxpayers. Singapore replaced a full imputation tax system in 2003 witha one-tier corporate tax system which exempts all dividends from personal tax when they havebeen subject to corporate tax.\\n37 The analysis here can be extended to accommodate uncertainty with common information by\\nnoting that the equilibrium condition on security returns holds in each state of nature when thecapital market is complete.\\n38 Their dividend payout ratio changed over the sample period from around 50 per cent prior to the\\n1980s to over 60 per cent during the 1980s and 1990s. It peeked at about 100 per cent in 1982 andthen declined to around two-thirds in the 1990s due largely to changes in the relative tax treatmentof capital gains and dividends.

Thus, in periodswhen capital gains are significant, firms with positive economic income can have negative measured income. Similar problems arise with capital losses because measured depreciationallowances are determined by applying standardized decay factors to the original purchase prices of assets, while economic depreciation allowances are determined by the reductions in theirmarket valuations.\\n43 We obtain these conditions by replacing the budget constraints for consumers in (2.11) with\\nwhere a\\nFis the number of units of franked dividend paying shares purchased at market price paF,\\nand aUthe number of units of unfranked dividend paying shares purchased at market price paU.

It is a functional mapping over the utility functions ofall consumers in the economy, who each obtain utility from their own consumption bundle. Inother words, this rules out consumers deriving utility from the consumption bundles chosen byothers. However, the social welfare function can take different forms to reflect variations in socialattitudes to inequality, ranging from complete indifference (utilitarian) to complete aversion(Rawlsian). We initially use a conventional Harberger analysis that assigns the same distributionalweights to consumers. This removes distributional effects from the welfare analysis and allows usto aggregate dollar changes in utility over consumers, where aggregate welfare gains representpotential Pareto improvements through an appropriate lump-sum redistribution. Distributionaleffects can be included by assigning different distributional weights to consumers.\\n2 A pure public good is defined to be perfectly non-rivalrous and non-excludable. It is difficult for\\nprivate suppliers to extract a fee from consumers when the good is non-excludable, which is why publicgoods are underprovided in private markets. It creates a free-rider problem where individuals can con-sume the benefits of goods supplied by others without making a contribution to their cost. Indeed,\\nthis can lead to strategic interactions between private suppliers. To avoid these problems, which are notthe focus of the current analysis, we assume the good is produced solely by the government.\\n3 The following analysis could be undertaken using generalized state preferences, but they do not\\nallow us to separate the impact of risk on equilibrium outcomes. Moreover, expected utility is arequirement for using one of the consumption-based pricing models examined earlier in Chapter4 to compute risk-adjusted discount rates on future cash flows.\\n4 In the following analysis we assume every consumer is a net supplier of the private good, with\\nand a net consumer in the second period, with We could allow\\nsome individuals to be net consumers in the first period (with x-\\nh\\n0 −xh\\n0<0) and some to be net sup-\\npliers in the second period, with However, the tax rates would then become subsidies,unless we allow them to change sign. But consumers would then face different relative commod-ity prices and use different discount factors to evaluate future consumption flows.\\n5 Since lump-sum transfers are non-distorting they make no contribution to the final welfare effects.\\nThis has important practical implications because it allows governments to separate policy evalu-ation across a number of specialist agencies. Treasury and finance departments can evaluate themarginal social cost of raising revenue with a range of different taxes without knowing how thefunds will be spent, while departments responsible for health, education, social security anddefence can evaluate the net benefits from their spending programmes independently of the waythey are financed. The final changes to the distorting taxes are determined by the impact projects haveon the government budget. If they drive it into deficit then distorting taxes must be raised to gen-erate additional revenue, while the reverse applies for projects that drive the budget into surplus.\\n6 There is a detailed examination of the role of lump-sum transfers in a conventional welfare analy-\\nsis in Jones (2005). Ballard and Fullerton (1992) argue that a conventional welfare analysis is notpossible when lump-sum transfers are ruled out. But they are only hypothetical transfers that weuse to separate the welfare effects of each policy variable, and they are eliminated inside projectsby tax changes made to balance the government budget.

It is well known that dollar changes in utility are ingeneral unreliable welfare measures for discrete (large) policy choices. Once the marginal utilityof income changes with real income, dollar changes in private surplus do not map into utility at aconstant rate and are therefore path-dependent. This is examined in detail by Auerbach (1985) andJones (2005). These problems do not arise in a marginal welfare analysis because changes in themarginal utility of income have higher-order effects that do not impact on final welfare changes.\\n10 This expression is obtained by using the first-order conditions for optimally chosen consumption,\\nwith and for all sand the first-order condition for optimally\\nchosen saving in (8.2).\\n11 Bergson (1938) initially described the individualistic social welfare function, while Samuelson\\n(1954) was the first to use it in formal analysis.\\n12 Individualistic social welfare functions rule out interdependencies between consumers where they\\nget utility from their own consumption bundle as well as the consumption bundles of others.However, they can be given functional forms that reflect social attitudes to income inequality rang-ing from complete indifference (utilitarian) to complete aversion (Rawlsian). These determine thevalues of the distributional weights assigned to consumers in the aggregate welfare changes.\\n13 Distributional effects can be included in the welfare analysis by assigning different distributional\\nweights to consumers. Typically there is an inverse relationship between these weights and income,where low-income consumers are assigned higher relative weights. But they are based on subjec-tive assessments that can differ across policy analysts. In some circumstances policy changes withefficiency losses, which isolate reductions in real income, can be socially profitable due to distri-butional effects. Most analysts report the efficiency and equity effects separately so that policy-makers can see the role played by subjectively determined distributional effects in the welfareanalysis.

       " Document(page_content='17 Atkinson and Stern make the important observation that positive revenue effects do not necessar-\\nily mean that the optimal supply of the public good is larger than it would be in an economy with-out tax distortions. The summed benefits and costs are measured in different economies and willnot in general be the same at each level of public good provision. In a tax-distorted economy theexcess burden of taxation reduces aggregate real income and this impacts on the marginal valua-tions consumers have for the private and public goods, where the resulting impact on prices canchange the cost of producing the public goods.\\n18 It is quite feasible that the project reduces net consumption of the private good in the second period,\\nbut it must increase net supply of the good (by reducing aggregate consumption demand) in the firstperiod to release the resources used to produce extra output of the public good. When net demandfalls in the second period the reduction in tax revenue is a welfare loss that increases the marginalcost of providing the good. It is possible for this loss to make the spending effect negative.\\n19 A number of studies obtain a modified measure of the MCF which combines the spending effects\\nfor projects with the conventional MCF in (8.14). Thus, the MCF is project-specific. For examplesof this, see Ballard and Fullerton (1992) and Snow and Warren (1996). Jones (2005) derives theformal relationship between the conventional and modified measures of the MCF .\\n20 Formally, the marginal excess burden of taxation for t\\n0is MEB0=−(dW/dt0)/(dT/dt0), where the \\nwelfare loss is solved using the conventional welfare equation in (8.7) as\\nIt is important to note that this loss is isolated using (hypothetical) lump-sum transfers to balance\\nthe government budget. When the tax is marginally raised the government returns the revenue to consumers through lump-sum transfers. Thus, the welfare loss is measured in a balanced equi-librium which is on the economy’ s production possibility frontier. The welfare effects for each ofthe policy changes can be isolated in this way. Once they are combined inside projects the lump-sum transfers are eliminated by the tax changes. Thus, we have \\nwhere MCF\\n0in (8.14) is equal to 1 +MEB0.\\n21 This special case is examined by Ballard and Fullerton (1992), and it is the outcome when utility\\nis (log-)linear in the public good.\\n22 For a detailed examination of the relationship between dollar changes in utility and the compen-\\nsated welfare changes see Jones (2005), where the Hatta (1977) decomposition is generalized to accommodate endogenous price changes.\\n23 The hats (^) over variables indicate they are computed with utility held constant and are therefore\\nbased solely on substitution effects.\\n24 These foreign aid payments are purely notional and have no impact on the utility of foreign \\nconsumers. Normally any changes in real income stay in the hands of domestic consumers. Wesimply compute potential foreign aid payments as a way to isolate the changes in real income frompolicy changes that ultimately impact on the utility of domestic consumers.\\n25 The actual change in expected utility from the project is derived as the second equation in (8.11).26 Graham looks at how to maximize the option value by redistributing income across states of\\nnature. But in project evaluation we want to evaluate the option value for consumption risk result-ing from the project, which is, in part, endogenously determined by consumers trading risk in pri-vate markets. If the government can reduce consumption risk by transferring income across statesof nature the value of the ex-ante CV rises. However, that introduces a separate policy choice withadditional costs. In particular, we need to consider whether the government can reduce consump-tion risk at lower cost than private traders, and since it cannot redistribute income across states ofnature using lump-sum transfers, it uses distorting taxes which have efficiency costs that makeredistribution costly.

But they may not be able to personalize therevenue transfers when using distorting taxes, which is why it is important to test for Paretoimprovements in policy evaluation. Jones derives a revised measure of the shadow value of gov-ernment revenue when consumers have different distributional weights and the government bal-ances its budget with distorting taxes; it is the distributional weighted sum of personalizedmeasures of the shadow value of government revenue, where strict Pareto improvements are pos-sible when tax changes make these personalized shadow values positive for every consumer.\\n29 Foster and Sonnenschein (1970) find S\\nRcan be negative in tax-distorted economies where multi-\\nple equilibrium outcomes are possible.

They show how stable price adjustment mechanisms, like the Walrasian auctioneer in acompetitive equilibrium, overcome this problem.\\n30 The derivation of this welfare equation is not provided here as it is similar to the derivation pro-\\nvided for the original welfare equation in (8.7).\\n31 The shadow value of capital is obtained using the welfare equation in (8.7 ′′) as:\\nWe obtain (8.25) by rearranging these terms to get\\n32 In a certainty setting the private discount factor is m=1/[1 + i(1 − τ)] for all s, where in the absence\\nof trade taxes the social discount rate becomes ψ=i(1 −τ) +τiα. This can be rearranged as ψ=α i +\\n(1 −α)i(1 −τ), where from the market-clearing condition is the change\\nin private saving.\\n33 If risk can be traded at lower cost using the tax system it would seem logical to argue that more cap-\\nital should be funded through the tax system. Indeed, in the extreme all investment would be fundedin this way, where the cost reductions could be obtained without the projects being undertakeninside the public sector. The government could simply raise capital for private producers. Clearly,there are important cost advantages from the current risk trading opportunities in private marketswhich have created considerable wealth for most countries in recent years. Traders in private capitalmarkets specialize in gathering information about projects being funded through sales of shares, debtand other financial instruments. They also specialize in creating risk-spreading opportunities by trad-ing derivative securities such as options and futures contracts which were examined in Chapter 6.1100 00 −= − ∂∂ =∂∂ α zx xx//Sp m it\\npx\\nxt\\nKs s\\nss =+ − −∂\\n∂⎛\\n⎝⎜⎞\\n⎠⎟+ ∑00\\n00\\n0011 1 πτ [() ]ppx\\nxiz\\nxs\\n00\\n00\\n0∂\\n∂+∂\\n∂⎧\\n⎨⎪\\n⎩⎪⎫\\n⎬⎪\\n⎭⎪τ .SdW\\ndxptx\\nxmtx\\nxipz\\nKs s\\nss\\ns == −∂\\n∂+∂\\n∂+∂∑\\n0000\\n01\\n00 πτ00\\n0∂⎧\\n⎨\\n⎩⎫\\n⎬\\n⎭x.', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 317}),\n",

Areas covered in the book include:\\n• An examination of the role of finance in the economy using basic economic principles,\\neventually progressing to introductory graduate analysis.\\n• A microeconomic study of capital asset pricing when there is risk, inflation, taxes and\\nasymmetric information.\\n• An emphasis on economic intuition using geometry to explain formal analysis.• An extended treatment of corporate finance and the evaluation of public policy.\\nWritten by an experienced teacher of financial economics and microeconomics at both', metadata={'source': 'Financial-Economics.pdf', 'page': 1})"

It is a mixed economy characterized by a blend of free-market principles and government intervention. Here are key aspects and characteristics of the USA economy:\\n\\nGDP and Growth: The USA has the largest economy in the world, with a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) exceeding $22 trillion (as of my last update in January 2022). The economy has shown consistent growth over the years, driven by factors like consumer spending, business investments, exports, and government spending.\\n\\nDiverse Industries: The economy is highly diversified, with significant contributions from various sectors. Some of the most prominent industries include finance, technology, healthcare, manufacturing, energy, and agriculture. The USA is a global leader in technology and innovation, particularly in areas like Silicon Valley for tech companies.\\n\\nLabor Market: The USA has a large and diverse labor force. Unemployment rates can vary but generally reflect the overall health of the economy. The labor market is dynamic, with workers often moving between industries and regions in response to economic conditions.\\n\\nMonetary Policy: The Federal Reserve (often referred to as the Fed) plays a crucial role in the economy by setting monetary policy. This includes controlling interest rates and managing the money supply to achieve goals like stable prices and maximum employment.\\n\\nFiscal Policy: The federal government uses fiscal policy to influence the economy through taxes and spending. Congress and the President work together to set budgets and make decisions that impact economic growth, employment, and inflation.\\n\\nInternational Trade: The USA is a major player in global trade, both importing and exporting a wide range of goods and services. Trade policies and agreements can significantly impact various industries and the overall economy.\\n\\nIncome Inequality: The USA has significant income inequality, with wealth concentrated among a relatively small percentage of the population. This issue has been a topic of debate and concern, with efforts made to address disparities in wealth distribution.\\n\\nEntrepreneurship and Innovation: The USA is known for its entrepreneurial culture and innovation. Many of the world's largest and most influential companies, particularly in technology, have originated from the USA.\\n\\nGovernment Role: While the USA embraces free-market principles, the government also plays an active role in regulating certain industries, providing social safety nets, and investing in infrastructure and research.\\n\\nChallenges: Like any economy, the USA faces challenges such as economic cycles, external shocks (like pandemics or geopolitical events), and ongoing debates about the appropriate role of government in the economy.\\n\\nOverall, the USA economy is complex, dynamic, and heavily influenced by both domestic and international factors. Its performance has implications far beyond its borders, given its global economic leadership and interconnectedness with other economies.\", metadata={'source': 'usa_economy.txt'})]"
