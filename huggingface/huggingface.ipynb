Those customers might be internal or external – the key is to think beyond simply offering data \\nsources, and expecting users to adapt or compromise the way they work to use it.\\nUnfortunately, there’s no silver bullet here. It takes time to understand your customers and their goals, \\nand involves real-world testing and constant refinement. And once you’ve solved that for one group of \\ncustomers, how do you scale and expand this? Can you make those products reusable, satisfying the \\nneeds of a broader range of customers?\\nAt Thoughtworks, we have adapted the Double-Diamond design process model to make sure that we \\nbuild the right thing and build it right . This starts with identifying what a customer needs. We use a \\nstructured discovery and inception process to uncover these requirements for any new data product. \\nWe then apply a set of well-understood practices and tools that are known to deliver high-quality \\nsoftware and data.'"
